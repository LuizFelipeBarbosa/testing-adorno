# Multi-label: a comment may have 0..N critique labels.
# NONE is set automatically when all critique labels are false.

labels:
  STANDARDIZATION:
    id: 0
    description: >
      Claims that songs are formulaic, repetitive, template-driven,
      or structurally interchangeable. Invokes sameness across the
      catalogue rather than within a single song's internal repetition.
    short: "formulaic / same / template"
    min_confidence: 0.50
    target_precision: 0.80

  PSEUDO_INDIVIDUALIZATION:
    id: 1
    description: >
      Claims of superficial uniqueness masking underlying sameness.
      The "brand" or "style" of an artist is recognized as a marketing
      veneer rather than genuine artistic distinction.
    short: "fake uniqueness / branding veneer"
    min_confidence: 0.50
    target_precision: 0.75

  COMMODIFICATION_MARKET_LOGIC:
    id: 2
    description: >
      Critique targeting chart optimization, algorithmic promotion,
      label strategy, virality gaming, or treating music as a product
      rather than art. References to streaming numbers, playlists,
      payola, or TikTok virality as drivers of success.
    short: "chart / algorithm / label / virality critique"
    min_confidence: 0.50
    target_precision: 0.80

  REGRESSIVE_LISTENING:
    id: 3
    description: >
      Critique of passive, background, low-attention, or
      non-critical consumption patterns. Listeners described as
      unable or unwilling to engage deeply with the music.
    short: "passive / background / shallow listening"
    min_confidence: 0.45
    target_precision: 0.70

  AFFECTIVE_PREPACKAGING:
    id: 4
    description: >
      Claims that emotion in the music is engineered, prefabricated,
      or manipulative. The emotional response is pre-designed by
      producers rather than arising from genuine artistic expression.
    short: "engineered / fake emotion"
    min_confidence: 0.45
    target_precision: 0.70

  FORMAL_RESISTANCE:
    id: 5
    description: >
      Recognition of genuine complexity, structural tension,
      anti-formula elements, or resistance to easy consumption.
      The commenter identifies something that breaks the mold
      or challenges standardized expectations.
    short: "complexity / anti-formula / genuine art"
    min_confidence: 0.40
    target_precision: 0.65
    note: "Rarest label; target recall >= 0.60"

  NONE:
    id: 6
    description: >
      No meaningful non-standard critique present. Includes pure
      fan reactions, lyric quoting, spam, emoji-only, and generic
      praise or hate without analytical content.
    short: "no critique"
    note: "Auto-assigned when all other labels are false"

# Mutual exclusivity rule
policy:
  multi_label: true
  none_rule: "NONE is true IFF all critique labels are false"
  sarcasm_handling: "reduce confidence, route to LLM/active-learning queue"
  quoted_text: "separate commenter voice from quoted lyrics where possible"
  trivial_reactions: "'this slaps', 'trash', 'fire' alone => NONE"
