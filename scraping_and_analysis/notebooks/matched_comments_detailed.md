> 100% agree. also what do you meeaannn, some of us loved it especially BECAUSE of its "strong Korean flavour" as you say 😆🩷 When a real effort is made to share a cultural experience, and express that in one's art, it truly connects! thats where Disney has been failing recently, imo. it fails to connect because its all so generic and... rinsed (eg. Snow White, Little Mermaid, Lion King and Lilo & Stitch live actions, Wish, etc) with the exception of Encanto, in their recent list. they're more afraid of hurting sentiments than concerned about telling an actual STORY

> The songs in this movie in no way sounds better than disney classic hits like "let it go","under the sea" and "you'll be in my heart"etc. to name a few which are actually singable. This song will be forgotten in a year given how none of the melody or production stands out. Many disney classic remains iconic to this day so I don't see how any of the tracks fare better than disney's best. Plus it sounds super generic, fake and so not kpop.

I'm quite grown up actually (will be a proper grown up of 62 this year 😂) and absolutely love jazz, bossa nova, rap, etc. I think Lola Young is fabulous, grew up on motown, Amy Winehouse is my hero. But find this a bit bland. I must admit I find Adele a bit bland too. Dave is amazing too and think Lily Allen's new album is brilliant (not as good as her album No Shame though which was the best). Haven't heard of any of the singers you've referenced but will make sure to educate myself. Love and light 😂 x

> I'll be honest a lot of guys that wanted to be prospects for marriage I didn't like them because they gave off weak-minded, low vibration energy very easily and emotionally manipulated types of guys I don't like those types of qualities I like strengths in all aspects of a person so I saw less of men in some of them which caused me to not respect them or look at them on a romantic level because they have a lot of wisdom and maturity to gain in life..So to me they are adolescent boys that dont know how to interact with a mature woman that is mentally, emotionally, psychologically strong I don't need weak men around me and I find that very unattractive it's a turn-off I don't feel I should have to raise someone like why should I have to raise a man he should be a man already if he's approaching me 😂

DING 0:26 Madame, there are no jeans on you to take off. All you're wearing is a leopard onesie. DING 0:37 I assume this question is rhethorical, because you just answered it yourself by throwing the keys onto the floor. DING 1:00 I don't know what this is yet, except possibly one of the weirdest car commercials, even weirder than that Jaguar one. DING 1:05 Having no Mrs, i.e. not being married, does not excuse cheating on your partner, Tate. DING 1:10 If by 'uh-uh', you mean exercising precise control over what is other wise a 200 miles-per-hour murder machine, I'm all for it. DING 1:12 If not, that's a moving violation. DING 1:23 It took 83 seconds only to show us the sports car of the 19th century. DING 1:35 Fortunately for you, we live in an age where turning 'so good it hurts' into simply 'really good' is one Tylenol away. DING 1:37 Before this verse, you were seen ominously staring at a horse. DING 1:42 On the corner of this stack of mattresses, the thing you did before this verse was most likely falling down. DING 1:45 Nothing says avant-garde interior design like a V10 engine block. DING 2:29 Let me remind you that at this point, we are 2 minutes and 30 seconds into a music video entitled 'Sports car', with no motor vehicles seen so far, so you do not have authority over not wasting time here. DING 2.35 For us go ride, I need you to stop wasting time dancing in an open aquarium first. DING 2:58 Yes, I know what this is: Prelude to the Premiere of "An Car" in A Phrygian Dominant.

> 🏆 TATE MCRAE: THE 2025 RECAP & 2026 ROADMAP 🏆 2025 was officially the year Tate McRae went from "rising star" to "global pop powerhouse." Between her record-breaking album So Close to What and her first-ever arena world tour, she has dominated the industry. Here is everything you need to know: 🔥 2025 AWARD WINS & DOMINATION Tate absolutely cleaned up at the major ceremonies in 2025, specifically in her home country and on the MTV stage. 1. The 2025 Juno Awards (The Big Winner) Hosted by Michael Bublé, Tate was the most-awarded artist of the night, taking home 4 out of her 5 nominations: ✨ Artist of the Year 💿 Album of the Year (for THINK LATER) 🎤 Pop Album of the Year 🎶 Single of the Year (for "greedy") 2. 2025 MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs) Tate’s contribution to the F1 movie soundtrack became the anthem of the year: ☀️ Song of the Summer ("Just Keep Watching") 🎬 Best Editing ("Just Keep Watching") 3. Other Notable Wins APRA Music Awards: Most Performed International Work ("greedy"). Hollywood Music Video Awards: Best Choreography ("It's OK I'm OK"). 🚀 BIG NOMINATIONS & MILESTONES (EARLY 2026) The momentum isn't stopping. As of January 2026, Tate is in the running for some of the biggest honors in music: 💎 2026 Grammy Awards: Nominated for Best Dance Pop Recording for "Just Keep Watching." (Winners announced Feb 1st!) 🎬 Guild of Music Supervisors Awards: Nominated for her work on the F1 soundtrack. 📻 iHeartRadio Music Awards: Nominated for Artist of the Year, Pop Artist of the Year, and Best Fan Army. 📈 Chart History: Her album So Close to What debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 and was certified Platinum in late 2025. 👀 WHAT’S COMING NEXT IN 2026? Tate is not slowing down. Here is the blueprint for the "TM4" era and beyond: 🌍 Miss Possessive Tour Extension: Due to overwhelming demand, Live Nation has added more arena dates for Summer 2026 across Europe and Asia. Fans in Japan and Southeast Asia—get your wallets ready! 🎹 The Fourth Album (TM4): Tate has teased that she is heading back into the studio.

> He looks great! Though not to to sound rude, but he does look a little plain in my opinion. Might I suggest some form of small pupils like white or red rings in the eyes to make it appear that something is in the skin. Perhaps also make the rows of teeth smaller with lots of space around the sides and a more blank expression. Maybe some rips along the torso or arms but all you can see through the rips is a dark void? Either way, I think it looks great. I like when people branch their EXEs to different characters besides Sonic. Sonic as an EXE is way overdone in my opinion. It’s refreshing to see Tails as an EXE. You did a great job in my opinion.

Some even have elements that suggest they had been exposed to Prince's genius. I celebrate these fabulous singers and the 10th year of Prince's passing. We know he's busy behind the scenes guiding these young artists... The industry tries to erase Prince's genius as they do with all black music of our past. They just don't play it. It's great to see that these artists have played it. Not for nothing, these British acts are still popping off the charts!

Bad Bunny gave back to our people in a moment when we needed it the most, bridging generational gaps and reminding the world of the beauty of our homeland and culture. He breathed new life into the magic of salsa, creating a timeless anthem that not only celebrates who we are but also unites us. This is more than a song—it’s a gift to Puerto Rico and a reminder of why BB's status as an icon and a genuinely good human being is undeniable.
