[Intro 1/1+Verse 1/2]
They say, "The holy water's watered down
And this town's lost its faith
Our colors will fade eventually"
So, if our time is runnin' out
Day after day
We'll make the mundane our masterpiece

[Pre-Chorus 1/2]
Oh my, my
Oh my, my love
I take one look at you

[Chorus 1/3]
You're takin' me out of the ordinary
I want you layin' me down 'til we're dead and buried
On the edge of your knife, stayin' drunk on your vine
The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowin' we found
Somethin' so out of the ordinary
You got me kissin' thе ground of your sanctuary
Shatter me with your touch, oh Lord, return mе to dust
The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowin' we found

[Verse 2/2]
Hopeless hallelujah
On this side of Heaven's gate
Oh, my life, how do ya
Breathe and take my breath away?
At your altar, I will pray
You're the sculptor, I'm the clay

[Pre-Chorus 2/2]
Oh my, my...

[Chorus 2/3]
You're takin' me out of the ordinary
I want you layin' me down 'til we're dead and buried
On the edge of your knife, stayin' drunk on your vine
The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowin' we found
Somethin' so out (Out) of the ordinary (Ordinary)
You got me kissing the ground (Ground) of your sanctuary (Sanctuary)
Shatter me with your touch, oh Lord, return me to dust
The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowin' we found

[Bridge 1/1]
Somethin' so heavenly, higher than ecstasy
Whenever you're next to me, oh my, my
World was in black and white until I saw your light
I thought you had to die to find

[Chorus 3/3 + Outro 1/1]
Somethin' so out of the ordinary
I want you laying me down 'til we're dead and buried
On the edge of your knife, stayin' drunk on your vine
The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowin' we found
Somethin' so out (Out) of the ordinary
You got me kissing the ground (Ground) of your sanctuary (Sanctuary)
Shatter me with your touch, oh Lord, return me to dust

> Trying just means not giving up so if you try you can’t lose and if you have nothing you have nothing to lose so just try I know there will always be bigger and harder problems but each time you solve one you get a little bit better cause the ultimate output of each problem solved isn’t that you solved the problem it’s you Pain is like the ground it will always be there sure you can take a plane to avoid it but you will always return to the ground there is no avoiding it pains the same way, like you can try to avoid it with drugs or scrolling or porn or whatever you want, but it's always gonna be there. So I think if you say pain is a bad thing, then you set yourself up to be unhappy forever, because you can never avoid it. Like pain is there. But the ground is not a bad thing. For sure. The ground is just proof that you're on Earth, and without it, you never learn how to walk. And pain, it is just proof that you're alive and And I think you need to let yourself feel the pain, because as much as we want to have these healthy, positive motivations, at least for me, it's a lot more effective to run from the pain. But just because you run from it doesn't mean it's bad. All that means is that it's something that makes you run. And here's the thing You don't need to know what you're running towards. All you need to know is what you don't want, and then you can run as fast as you can in the other direction. Because if the thing you're running from is wanting to end your own life like it's that bad, that death is a viable option, no amount of suffering or discomfort is gonna be worse than that, right? So just pick something, it doesn't even matter what, and just put the pain towards that. Because, you know, you're gonna suck in the beginning because you don't know what you're doing and you're new. But if you do something for enough time, enough times, you will become good at it. And if you're good at something, it's a hell of a lot easier to enjoy it. So that's how I see it.

> @Alex-Kuzma
Are you holding your guitar? Do you have the chords yet? Can you play the song? Ear it out, just like Rick taught you. 
Don't read my chords, until you give it a try, then I'll give them to you (after listening to the song 1 time through and learning it in real time, so there its a basic interpretation, I'm a basic guy)
Intro: Em, D    (12 fret bar the top 3 strings for Em, then drop down to D major 11, 10,10.  Pick them straight and down in triplets, and to nail the timing quickly, just play the lowest note only right on the quarter note. Once you do that, you'll have it.)
Chorus: Em, walk up to G major (E, F#, G), then keep walking, (A, Bm, then back down to 'A', then back down 'F#, E'.) It's a really walking part, so just keep walking up to the next chord, then back down, then all the way back down through F# back to Em.   The song is in Em so it's always, Em, G major, A major, Bm. 
It's also really fun to, on the very first low note introduction to reach down and pluck your open low E string with the piano, and then pluck the open D string when you switch to the D chord. It messed my timing up, but if you nail it, it would be real good.
That's about all I know, as I only listened to it once.
Great song, gave me goosebumps after listening to the back story. And the girl was so pretty, the low end was so thick and rich, the singing very syncopated (try playing and singing it, if you do that, you're doing real good.), I really enjoyed it.

>  @Makeupbykimberlyp  On April 2019, I heard - Tell them I am coming soon. Later in the day I heard: There will be a great shaking. When I didn't tell a particular church about it, I got a dream where I was scared. I could hear myself saying: I'll tell them, I'll tell them, I'll tell them. Then I saw a person in the dark with well lit church windows behind him and another person dressed in white walking behind him and up some stairs.

Jesus is coming. Good time to be right with Him. On April 9, 2021, my vision went black for a quick moment, I saw in gold letters - Thus saith the Lord.  Four hours later? On April 10, in my sleep I heard - Prophet. Tell them I am coming soon. Maybe 3-5 min after that, at 1235 AM, our area had a 3.1 eq.

Rev 3 vs 3  Have in mind therefore in what manner thou hast received and heard - and observe and do penance - If then thou shalt not watch, I will come to thee as a thief - and thou shalt not know at what hour I will come to thee.

> @TDAJuanxd Yes, you can.

Jesus is coming. Good time to be right with Him. On April 9, 2021, my vision went black for a quick moment, I saw in gold letters - Thus saith the Lord.  Four hours later? On April 10, in my sleep I heard - Prophet. Tell them I am coming soon. Maybe 3-5 min after that, at 1235 AM, our area had a 3.1 eq.

Rev 3 vs 3  Have in mind therefore in what manner thou hast received and heard - and observe and do penance - If then thou shalt not watch, I will come to thee as a thief - and thou shalt not know at what hour I will come to thee. 

Rom 10 vs 9  For if thou confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in thy heart that God hath raised him up from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

> Honestly, you don't understand how much I needed to read this. Wife left me and now I'm struggling to start over. Haven't seen my son and can't go back because of her having another man sleeping in my room. I'm strong but not when you involve my son. Don't get to hear his toddler speak anymore it hurts so much. May God send you blessings for posting this message. It's only been a week but I already feel so weak. Its something I still don't how to process. Could've I have done more so that she would still love me. Am I so weak that I don't deserve respect yet I was strong enough to pick up her broken pieces. Be the punching bag that no one wanted to notice. Is love to much to ask for

> I'm so sorry, it's a tough road ahead. But know that his love will be with you always. It's only now, 7 years after my husband passed that he feels more distant. Keep talking to him, look up "continuous bonds" that brought me much comfort and ignore Khubler Ross (she's now outdated). Look after yourself. Grief does weird things with time.  You'll think, it's been ages, and people will tell you that it's still recent. Know you are not alone. Many are walking that path of grief with you, some further along with a lighter burden, some struggling under the crushing weight of a recent loss, but all of us carrying the grief, always, and the love. Big hugs. ❤❤

> Hey, I don't know if this is going to be upsetting or anything, but I felt compelled to say this- from what I read you went through a lot to get where you are, and I will just say that I don't know what your parents felt with their own problems, but there's a whole world of parents elevated by your work who would be proud to call you their son, self included, and grandparents proud to call you a grandson. Sometimes we fail, and the kids succeed in spite of us. We're proud of the man you are. And if you want to delete and block, I understand. Most people inspire future generations to be better-- but the real ones inspire even past generations.

> Another beautiful sunset I see in San Juan
Enjoying all those things that the ones who leave end up missing
Enjoying nights like the ones that don’t happen anymore
That don’t happen anymore

But wanting to go back to the last time I looked into your eyes
And tell you the things I never told you (you look like my crush, haha)
And take the pictures of you that I never took
Damn, I swear you look really beautiful, let me take a picture of you
Hey, my chest’s bare, I went all out
My heart’s kicking me hard
Tell me, baby, where are you
So I can pull up with Roro, Julito, Cristal
Roy, Édgar, Seba, Óscar, Dalnelly, Big J playing the batá drums
Tonight we’re tearing the streets up
And it’d be awesome if you played the güiro
When I see your name, I start sighing
I don’t know if they’re fireworks or gunshots
My white girl, my stash, my kilo
I’m chilling in PR, but

I should’ve taken more pictures when I had you
I should’ve given you more kisses and hugs whenever I could
I hope my people never move away
And if I get drunk today, well, let them help me

I should’ve taken more pictures when I had you
I should’ve given you more kisses and hugs whenever I could
I hope my people never move away
And if I get drunk today, well, let them help me

Hey, today I’m gonna be with grandpa all day playing dominoes
If he asks me if I still think about you, I’ll tell him no
That my time close to you is already over
It’s already over

Hey, fire up the engines, I’m heading to Santurce
They’re still partying hard here, check out the girls
Damn, baby, how sweet
Today I wanna drink, drink, drink
And talk nonsense until they kick me out

I’m really crazy (I’m really crazy), I’m really crazy (I’m really crazy)
Bro, you drive, because even walking I’m bumping into things
I’m really crazy (I’m really crazy), I’m really crazy (I’m really crazy)
Let’s enjoy it, you never know if we’ve got little time left

I should’ve taken more ph-

Guys, I love you all so much
Thank you for being here, seriously
It really means a lot to me that you’re here
Each and every one of you means so much to me
So let’s take the picture, come here
Everybody get in, the whole crew, let’s go
Go

Now Bernie has a baby boy, and Jan has a baby girl
We’re not about movies and chains anymore
We’re about things that are worth it
For reggaeton, salsa, bomba and plena
Check out how mine sounds

I should’ve taken more pictures when I had you
I should’ve given you more kisses and hugs whenever I could
I hope my people never move away
And that you send me more nudes
And if I get drunk today, let Beno help me.

Otro sunset bonito que veo en San Juan
Disfrutando de todas esas cosas que extrañan los que se van (Van, van)
Disfrutando de noche' de esas que ya no se dan (Dan, dan)
Que ya no se dan (Dan)
Pero queriendo volver a la última vez
Y a los ojos te miré
Y contarte las cosas que no te conté (Te parece' a mi crush, jaja)
Y tirarte la' foto' que no te tiré (Acho, jura'o te ves bien linda, déjame tirarte una foto)
Ey, tengo el pecho pela'o, me dio una matá'
El corazón dándome patá'
Dime, baby, ¿dónde tú está'?
Pa' llegarle con Roro, Julito, Cristal
Roy, Edgar, Seba, Óscar, Dalnelly, Big J, tocando batá
Hoy la calle la dejamo' 'esbaratá
Y sería cabrón que tú me toque' el güiro
Yo veo tu nombre y me salen suspiro'
No sé si son petardo' o si son tiro'
Mi blanquita, perico, mi kilo
Yo estoy en PR, tranquilo, pero



 KATSEYE 'My Way' Lyrics & Meaning | Genius Verified

[Estribillo]
Debí tirar más fotos de cuando te tuve
Debí darte más beso' y abrazo' las vece' que pude
Ey, ojalá que los mío' nunca se muden
Y si hoy me emborracho, pues que me ayuden
Debí tirar más foto' de cuando te tuve
Debí darte más beso' y abrazo' las veces que pude
Ojalá que los mío' nunca se muden
Y si hoy me emborracho, pues que me ayuden

[Verso 2]
Ey, hoy voy a estar con abuelo to'l día, jugando dominó
Si me pregunta si aún pienso en ti, yo le digo que no
Que mi estadía cerquita de ti ya se terminó, ya se terminó
Ey, que prendan la' máquina', voy pa' Santurce
Aquí todavía se da caña
Chequéate las babie', diablo, mami, qué dulce
Hoy yo quiero beber, beber, beber
Y hablar mierda hasta que me expulsen
'Toy bien loco ('Toy bien loco), 'toy bien loco ('Toy bien loco)
Cabrón, guía tú, que hasta caminando yo estoy que choco
'Toy bien loco ('Toy bien loco), 'toy bien loco ('Toy bien loco)
Vamo' a disfrutar, que nunca se sabe si nos queda poco
Debí tirar más f—

[Interludio]
Gente, lo' quiero con cojone', los amo
Gracias por estar aquí, de verdad
Para mí e' bien importante que estén aquí
Cada uno de ustede' significa mucho para mí
Así que, vamo' pa' la foto, vengan pa'cá
Métase to'l mundo, to'l corillo, vamo'

[Verso 3]
Ya Bernie tiene el nene y Jan la nena'
Ya no estamo' pa' la movie' y las cadena'
'Tamos pa' las cosa' que valgan la pena
Ey, pa'l perreo, la salsa, la bomba y la plena
Chequéate la mía cómo es que suena

[Outro]
Debí tirar más fotos de cuando te tuve
Debí darte más besos y abrazo' las veces que pude
Ojalá que los mío' nunca se muden
Y que tú me envíe' más nude'
Y si hoy me emborracho, que Beno me ayude

Debí darte más besos y abrazos las veces que pude

Si me pregunta si aún pienso en ti, yo le digo que no
Que mi estadía cerquita de ti ya se terminó
Ya se terminó
Ey, que prendan las máquinas, voy pa Santurce
Aquí todavía se da caña, chequéate a las babies
Diablo, mami, qué dulce
Hoy yo quiero beber, beber, beber
Y hablar mierda hasta que me expulsen
Toy bien loco (toy bien loco), toy bien loco (toy bien loco)
Cabrón, guía tú, que hasta caminando yo estoy que choco
Toy bien loco (toy bien loco), toy bien loco (toy bien loco)
Vamo a disfrutar, que nunca se sabe si nos queda poco

Gente, los quiero con cojone, los amo
Gracias por estar aquí, de verdad

> My uncle's Grandfather (舅爷爷)died in a motorcycle accident a few days ago, a few days before Chinese New Year.
And my mother's side of Grandma died in peace last year, also a few days before Chinese New Year.
They both are a big part of my life, and are just gone in just a second. I was outside of town, can't even make it to the hospital.
As a Chinese, especially in my 30s, most of us are already out of our hometown, Swatow/Shantou(汕头), to make it out for a living in the big cities like Guangzhou or Shenzhen. While I was living in Xiamen, struggling to keep myself alive, I still miss the food, the scenery, the memories, the parents, and the homies in Swatow.
Every time I heard this song, even I don't know any Spanish(Shout out to all the local translators), but I can hear the loneliness, sadness, and also the "i got u homie" vibes.
It also brings me a message: You gotta do something when it's not too late.
So I did.
When I get back to my hometown, bumping this song repeatedly, I immediately tryin' my best to speak Teochew dialect every single time when I have the opportunity to talk to someone, even my first language is Mandarin. And taking loads of photos of everything: The family, the scenery, the locals, the homies.
Last night I was in a car with my family, I posted all the photos on my local social media, and a screenshot of the"Debí tirar más fotos de cuando te tuve
Debí darte más besos y abrazo' las veces que pude"line with Chinese Translations of it.
My mother smiled and asked me why I didn't shoot the photo with any notice. I told her to see all of my photos, and when she saw the screenshot and read the line in Chinese, I cried and hugged her in the back seat.
Today is the first day of the Chinese New Year, the Year of the Horse. I hope you can keep rocking and doing your best. I hope everything you dreamed will be succeed, and also, when the time is right, take more photos, call or meet often with your family, your homies, please! 
Thank you so much for making this song, Bad Bunny and the team! ALL LOVE AND F ICE.

> Eu tive um grande amor há 4 anos. Ela se chamava Nathaly Alves Dufner, e até hoje penso muito nela. Ainda sonho que um dia possamos nos reencontrar. Depois dela vieram outros relacionamentos, mas ela foi a mulher que eu mais amei na minha vida.
Infelizmente, a mãe dela pediu para que terminássemos, pois pensou que eu poderia bater na filha dela. Talvez pudéssemos ter continuado ao menos como amigos, mas na época eu recusei, porque era imaturo. Hoje, eu daria tudo para conversar com ela mais uma vez, para ter mais um abraço, mais um beijo e mais fotos. Eu deveria ter feito tudo isso quando tive a chance.
Eu sei que ela não vai voltar e talvez nem se lembre mais de mim, mas eu sempre me lembrarei dela.
Eu tinha 16 anos quando a conheci, na escola, na primeira série — se não me engano. Mesmo que já tenham se passado alguns anos, eu nunca vou esquecer o quanto eu a amei. E parte de mim ainda ama.
Se algum dia você ver essa mensagem, saiba que Enzo Ferreira Bahamondes — ou, como seus familiares costumavam me chamar, “Gesequinho” — nunca te esqueceu e nunca vai esquecer, porque você foi a mulher que eu mais amei e caso queira falar comigo algum dia meu Instagram ainda é gesequinho, espero que no futuro possamos nós encontrar novamente.

> what the description says in english

From the full and the bomb to the reggaeton

(1500s-1990s)

In the mid-nineteenth century, the musical genre of dance emerged, created in the city of Ponce and influenced by the European tradition.

La borinqueña, the song that will later become the anthem of Puerto Rico, was composed as a dance in 1867. The following year the poet Lola Rodriguez de Tió wrote the lyrics to what is known today as "The Revolutionary Borinqueña."

The lyrics were an ode and a call to arms in the struggle for the independence of Puerto Rico. These lyrics were written in the revolutionary context of the Grito de Lares, an independence insurrection that took place on September 23, 1868.

At the beginning of the next century, in 1903, Manuel Fernández Juncos rewrote the lyrics of the song where he alluded to the discovery of Puerto Rico and its natural beauty.

This will be the version that the government of Puerto Rico will adopt as the official anthem in 1952.

Ahora de vez en cuando aun me doy en el pecho q debi haber estado ahi. Siempre recuerdo q la ultima vez q la vi le dije abuela yo vuelvo pero no fue asi. Era la unica abuela que me quedaba y ya no la tengo. Mi familia aprendio a vivir sin mi pero yo aun no supero vivir sin ellos ya no se si vale la pena seguir aca y deseo regresar y nada aqui afuera aun estoy estrañando el coqui 💔 Gracias Bad Bunny en verdad si debi tirarle mas fotos de cuando la tube, debi darle mas besos y abrazos las veces q pude 😞😭

>  @Rennzz-r2r  Trata acerca de la nostalgia de lo que se hizo, pero también de lo que no fue posible realizar, por alguna u otra razón. Es una suerte de arrepentimiento doloroso por no capturar momentos que en su tiempo prefirió no fotografiarlos por vivir sencillamente el presente, pero que luego se ve en la fatídica necesidad de querer visualizarlos no solo en los recuerdos, sino también en algo material, en una foto. Bad centra su atención en una persona en especial, pero se pudiera aplicar este pensamiento a absolutamente todo, porque al fin de cuentas todo deja una huella en nuestra vida. Me atrevo a decir que es también una linda forma de agradecer a la vida y a las personas por el pasado, porque al querer tener fotografías es porque considera que, aunque ese tiempo y esas personas no van a volver, para él siguen siendo valiosos. 🫱🏽‍🫲🏼❤️‍🩹

> Que mucho me he gozado esta canción, pero que mucho me ha hecho llorar también. Soy mexicana, hace 9 años me vine a vivir a los Estados Unidos y hace 7 años que no voy para México, y como extraño, cuantas ganas de volver. Perder a mi tía hace 4 meses, que más que una tía, fue una madre para mí, y no haber podido ir a mi país y por lo menos darle un último adiós, me sigue doliendo en el alma. Yo creí que estar lejos de casa realmente ya no me afectaba, hasta que aconteció el fallecimiento de mi tía, y me di cuenta que, la herida de alguna forma sigue ahí, y que aún sigue doliendo.
¡Gracias, Benito! Tremendo tema, tremendo álbum. Gracias por recordarnos el vivir y gozar el aquí y el ahora, y a disfrutar de los que amamos mientras los tenemos presentes. 🫶🏻

> "DtMF" is a nostalgic reflection on the importance of treasuring moments with loved ones. Bad Bunny expresses regret for not capturing more photographs during meaningful experiences, emphasizing how those memories become valuable over time. The song invites us to value the present and the people around us, reminding us of the transience of life and the relevance of preserving memories.
Bad Bunny has sparked speculation about his relationship with his ex-girlfriend, Gabriela Berlingeri. Some fans interpret the lyrics as reflecting nostalgia and regret for not having captured more moments during his relationship with her. Lines like "I should have taken more photos, kissed more, hugged more" suggest a desire to have treasured more memories together.

> I know Bad Bunny by way of liking Karol G.  Cooks in restaurant I work at were listening to this today and I dug it.  Granted they know I already listen to A LOT of what they frequently listen to.  Carin Leon, Mon Laferte, Gloria Trevi, Angela Aguilar, Natalia Lafourcade, Carla Morrison, Aida Cuevas, Natalia Jimenez.  Surprised I dig this song Triple Lavada by Esau Ortiz.  Keep in mind I do not understand Spanish, but dig the music, 98% of what I listen to is that, been to 2 concerts (Mon Laferte and then Angela Aguilar, Pepe Aguilar, Leonardo Aguilar and others....Jaripeo Sin Fronteras tour cpl years ago).  Super Bowl show should be quite energetic.  Love Karol G, would be cool if she can make an appearance.

Eso solo lo logran los grandes artistas. No me gustaba antes... pero luego de ese show, fue impresionante, convertir lo simple y cotidiano en arte mundial... me encantó❤fue un antes y un después, eh? Veía que Michael Jackson había hecho un antes y un después.. y esto fue, mágico, cultural, de libertad, arte revolucionario, y en español... fue un antes y un después!

> This shit has got me crying, I want to thank the person who made this.
When my grandfather first died, I was fairly young. At the time, I was so surprised that I didn't even cry at his funeral. Listening to this song made me think of him. It was the first time I truly felt what he meant to me. I cried listening to this, after I realized that he was the only man in my life who ever wanted me to be better than him. He was the only man who kept me around because he loved me, not because I had something to give him. I never paid him back what I owed him through what he did for my life. That was the only time I never gave someone back what I owed.

Sin embargo, al fin y al cabo, logramos ser lo mejor que podíamos y de lo que se esperaba de nosotros: calurosos, alegres, vibrantes, talentosos, exitosos, bellos adentro y afuera, con una identidad que todo el planeta reconoce y quería para sí.

> To honest, I think that this would have been way better as a tv show instead.
Like, I don't like the fact that the backstory of the Demons, the Demon Hunters and The Kpop trio are just speedrunned in the first ten minutes, as it just makes the movie feel way too rushed and come across as Netflix trying to fit in a 10 episode TV show into a 90 minute movie
This problem is made worse by the fact that it makes the Demon Hunters backstory come across as very vague and under explained. Are the Demon Hunters like, a thing that one specific family dedicated the rest of time to or do they just pick random aspiring singers to be on their team?
If the latter part is true, then how did they react to the fact that they have to also stop a world ending threat from consuming human souls instead of just writing songs that millions would listen to and live a life of luxury?
I mean, being a Kpop star is already stressful and pressuring enough so why did they even choose to be a Demon Hunter?
Why just three people? Why aren't there hundreds of Girl groups that dedicate themselves to slowing down this Demonic force? Listen, I could just list all of the things that this movie keeps vague and unexplained, but it would take like, a billion words just to list them out. The point is, this movie does not do a good job at explaining what the Demon hunters are and how they work.

> TV series where Huntrix and Saja Boys are end game. Like, hear me out: You saw how the Saja were more human in appearance and look eerily similar to the Korean Grim Reapers. Plus, let's be real, Ya really think Gwi-Ma will take the defeat laying down? So like, obvious music is a key thing; originals, covers (Hey if Trolls can do covers like Sweet Dreams, Kpop can do a cover of like...idk Alice Cooper's Poison). Three songs per episode.

Now, 'Sage', I hear you ask 'Where do the Saja Boys come in?' Easy. They make it back since the Honmoon doesn't recognize them as demons but reapers. So the idol rivalry returns, but with a fun ally twist. I'll use Baby as an example, he shows up, of course he goads our ladies. "You know this Rainbow Honmoon isn't as strong as you think since I'm here." Mira snaps "Tell us something we don't know!" while holding the holy spear at him. Baby goes "Okay. Penguins don't have knees, Star Wars actually starts on 'Episode Four', The Original killer in Friday the 13th was Jason's mom and Jason didn't start killing until the second movie. Oh, and there's a set of crow demons five streets from here." Once Huntrix heads out on the demon of the episode? Sajas take the stage and their songs reflect what the demon of the episode is. And we get more lore on our faves.

> As my name doesn't indicate, I was born in Korea and was adopted. I always felt like I had to explain everything to others: my parents are not like me but French; the country where I was born is somewhere between China and Japan. I am now 49 years old, and it has been 2 years (only) that I have been reviving my Korean roots, fully embracing Korean culture and proudly wearing (especially through modern hanboks) this identity that I ignored so much out of a desire to integrate and which nevertheless gives me so much energy today: that of childhood where one is so curious, daring and ambitious. I received the song "Golden" as a new healing treatment for my flaw, my wound. The more I listen to it, the more it moves me. I also consider it as a confirmation of what I have secretly wished for since my middle school years: I can make my place by assuming who I am entirely and do great things in this world, not only for my family and loved ones, but also for the people with whom I may be in contact, or who may be touched (not by my vocal performances!) by the gestures or words I could address to them. That would give so much meaning to my coming into the world!

> I started my clinical research all on my own while working at a suburban hospital in Japan and pursuing graduate school. I decided not to leave my hospital even after enrolling, because I felt it was my responsibility to keep caring for my patients. Balancing research and clinical work was an incredibly tough journey—there was no one to lean on, and I faced countless rejections from journals.

In the middle of that despair, I stumbled upon “Golden” by Demon Hunters. The song reminded me that even when everything feels heavy and impossible, there is still a light to hold on to, and I can keep moving forward. It became the voice that pushed me to believe: “I can make it through, even if no one else has.”

Thanks to that song, I found the strength to keep going. My efforts finally paid off—my paper was accepted, and my work could finally see the light of day. I can’t thank you enough.

From here on, I’ll keep being a doctor who never forgets the patients right in front of me, while also doing what I can to make life a little brighter for people with rheumatoid arthritis all over the world.

Je ne dirais toutefois pas comme vous que j'ai fait preuve de courage, mais seulement d'une intense volonté de vivre... pleinement. Certes, ce n'est pas toujours facile de ne pas se sentir à sa place, et encore moins de se faire rejeter une 2ème fois par son géniteur qui a expliqué en 2018 à Holt qu'ayant refait sa vie, il ne voulait absolument pas entendre parler de moi pour ne pas rencontrer de difficultés avec sa famille. Mais quel bonheur, une fois disparus tous les filtres de mal-être et de distanciation, que de pouvoir s'ouvrir aux autres, que de pouvoir voir que l'on me voit et que l'on veut simplement, généreusement m'aider dans mon cheminement (l'ascension du Bukhansan notamment !) ; quel bonheur de pouvoir s'ouvrir à des opportunités qui font sens dans ma vie et qui contribuent à affirmer fièrement mon identité ! Concernant la musique, je ne pensais vraiment pas que mon chanteur préféré (Lee Mujin) puisse lui aussi contribuer à ce travail de guérison !

Mais comme vous êtes jolie !" ou bien "Je suis sincèrement désolé", contribuent à soigner, à réparer mon trauma, qui, j'en ai un peu l'impression, est partagé non seulement par les milliers d'enfants coréens adoptés mais aussi par la nation coréenne.

> Usually the issue is a lot of the Disney esque movies lately have suffered a from the Mary Sue complex where the female characters are constantly doing/displaying skills or talents outside of their obvious wheel house. Which gets especially grating when it is female leads who are just generally unlikable or unpleasant to watch interacting with people. For example the Tolkien animated movie that was released a year or so back, where she started off as a semi reasonable character who randomly a bit past halfway through the movie suddenly had every skill under the sun, and who was portrayed as always doing the right thing even when it made no damn sense. It is hard for people to bond with or watch a character grow who is cannot make mistakes or fail, which does pop up occasionally in male orientated media, but the last decade or so has been very nonstop.

All that said this seems like it might be worth checking out, and while the song isn't my cup of tea it was enjoyable.

> I don't know how they'd continue the story, at least not with these characters. It has a pretty clear conclusion to the overarching story for the characters involved. And I don't know how they'd improve upon it to make a sequel, they just got it right. I think it would feel really forced if after they achieved a golden honmoon that it somehow collapses and Gwi Ma somehow introduces a stronger threat that a fully united cast would still struggle with. Though I agree it definitely deserved a theatrical release, but the execs probably decided that was too much risk. I could, however, see them make a serialized episode series telling stories that happened before Rumi saw a flash of gold. It would also be an opportunity to expand upon the lore in a safer way to somehow make a sequel movie work.

> I dont understand what people mean when they say they’re “not a Kpop fan.” this isn’t a genre of music in the sense of it being country or pop or rnb as it literally encompasses multiple different musical styles. 

Like are you all just staying willfully ignorant to any music that’s not set in your native language instead of appreciating it for its beauty or lyrical prowess? 
You cant be not into kpop, not if you like pop, rnb, electronic, hip hop, etc etc. Because its literally just those musical styles and more in Korean but with more of a focus on intricate choreography and a visual stage presentation compared to Western standards. But the songs are still essentially the same, just in a different language.

I picked K-Pop Demon Hunters. We cringed together. We laughed together. I know I had tears in my eyes at multiple points. But I dont know about her, because I couldn't look away from the tv. And as soon as it was over, I turned to my sister and almost asked her "do you want to watch that again?"

But instead we just sort of sat there in stunned silence. It was such a deep and surprisingly human story, and it was such a shock to both of us how we never even touched the remote except to turn up the volume. Incredible movie.

Thank you so much. It’s been just one day, and I feel truly honored to receive so many kind reactions.

You said, “Why is your English so good?” but honestly, I’m really not good at speaking or listening in English. I can manage reading and writing to some extent, but that’s all.

The comment I wrote about “Golden” was simply to encourage myself and to show my respect for this song. It was nothing more than my own self-satisfaction, and maybe that’s why it came out a little poetic.

But seeing everyone’s reactions here gave me even more motivation to keep working hard in my job (clinical practice) from tomorrow.

Thank you truly, from the bottom of my heart.

The story of Rumi overcoming the fact that she's half-human, half-demon and mustering up the courage to defeat the devil that she can't reveal to the world is actually intertwined with the struggles of the singer EJAE, who sang this song, during her unknown days as a trainee, and the fact that she's finally becoming known to the world through this song is what makes the song even more poignant and profound. That's why the emotion you feel while watching the movie is a mixture of inexplicable emotions and tears that come later.

Pensaba que contigo iba a envejecer
En otra vida, en otro mundo podrá ser
En esta solo queda irme un día
Y solamente verte en el atardecer

Si me ven solo y triste, no me hablen
Si me ven solo y triste, soy culpable
La vida es una fiesta que un día termina
Y fuiste tú mi baile inolvidable
Y fuiste tú mi baile inolvidable
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh

Mientras uno está vivo
Uno debe amar lo más que pueda

Pensaba que contigo iba a envejecer
En otra vida, en otro mundo podrá ser
En esta solo queda irme un día
Y ver pa'l cielo a ver si te veo caer

Si me ven solo y triste, no me hablen
Si me ven solo y triste, soy culpable
La vida es una fiesta que un día termina
Y fuiste tú mi baile inolvidable

No, no te puedo olvidar
No, no te puedo borrar
Tú me enseñaste a querer
Me enseñaste a bailar

No, no te puedo olvidar
No, no te puedo borrar
Tú me enseñaste a querer
Me enseñaste a bailar (yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh)

Ey, dime cómo le hago pa olvidarte
Hay un paso nuevo que quiero enseñarte
En las noches ya ni puedo dormir
Lo que hago es soñarte

No, no te puedo olvidar
No, no te puedo borrar
Tú me enseñaste a querer
Me enseñaste a bailar

Como tú me besabas, como yo te lo hacía
Como tú me mirabas, bellaquito me ponía
Se siente feo no tenerte cerquita
La nueva mama bien, pero no es tu boquita

Mi diabla, mi ángel, mi loquita
Mi diabla, mi ángel, mi loquita, ey

Esto suena cabrón
Vamo a hacerlo otra vez
Como anoche, como anoche
Aprieta, chamaquito, aprieta

¡Ahí, ahí, ahí, vamo allá!

No, no te puedo olvidar
No, no te puedo borrar
Tú me enseñaste a querer
Me enseñaste a bailar

Ay, yo con cualquiera me puedo acostar
Pero no con cualquiera quiero despertar
Solo con usted, con usted
Yo bailo con usted, nada más con usted
Un beso donde estés, donde estés, bebé (no, no te puedo olvidar)

No, no te puedo borrar
Tú me enseñaste a querer
Me enseñaste a bailar

Y yo he tenido muchas novias
Pero como tú, ninguna
Ya no tengo mi sol, me paso en la luna
Si te pienso, me tiro de una, eh-eh

Mi diabla, mi ángel, mi loquita
Mi diabla, mi ángel, mi loquita, eh-eh

>  @jfender8023  Yo detesto la etiqueta y solamente me identifico como puertorriqueño, luego como antillano y, si acaso, como caribeño. Puede que en Puerto Rico sí haya gente originaria de provincias romanas. En el siglo XIX llegaron a ser 16% de nuestro país personas con origenes en Córcega. Puerto Rico tiene herencias muy diversas no circunscritas a la peninsula ibérica. Ahora bien, incluso a través de nuestra herencia española también somos herederos del sistema de derecho hispano-romano y de genes de antiguas provincias romanas, si bien ello se enmarca dentro de una realidad genética multirracial. Sin mencionar que en América Latina, sin incluímos a Brasil, o la América Hispana sino, existen millones de criollos blancos. Entonces, sí que se podría decir que somos latinos. No sé si al ser español, y noto una voz española en tu redacción, piensas o reduces lo de ser latino a un asunto racial, en cuyo caso solamente los españoles, portugueses, italianos, y si acaso franceses (aunque los francos son muy germánicos y solo el sur de Francia parece algo ¨latino¨), pero lo cierto es que independientemente del asunto genético europeos, ampliamente presente esos genes en Latino América, tanto en criollos como en mestizos y mulatos, hablamos un idioma derivado del latín. Que eso no constituya una cultura, una etnia, o una raza, como algunos parecen malinterpretar- es decir no existe la identidad latina- no quiere decir que no seamos latino americanos en virtud del idioma y sí, herencia genética, y cultural también.

> A ver,Bad Bunny canta horrible,obvio el reggueaton no es para todo mundo. Su música no son instrumentos,sus letras son sumamente vulgares y tener miles de seguidores no es sinónimo de talento,éxito si. En este último disco se lució con su música,con esa orquesta,con las letras,aunque de repente estás oyendo una buena canción y sale con sus frases corrientes 😂 Aún con todo eso,es enorme en donde pone a los latinos,hispanos o como quieran llamarnos a todos los que hablamos español en este Continente,nos ha llevado por todo el mundo. Por siglos nos han tratado como personas de segunda clase,segunda mano,nunca se nos ha dado crédito por los logros que toda nuestra gente logra a todos niveles,nos minimizan,nos tachan de absolutamente todo lo malo que pueda existir en la tierra. Tenemos una cultura riquísima,todos y cada uno de nuestros Países son hermosos,la música inigualable,nuestras comidas,somos corazón,apreciamos las cosas sencillas y reales,somos algarabía,celebramos la vida a pesar de todo lo feo que nos pasa,nos levantamos del maldito suelo,somos resilientes,damos la mano e igual nos reímos de nuestras desgracias y hoy él nos representa a todos. Hoy vamos a disfrutar al Benito y el escucharlo cantando  en nuestro hermoso español...Lo que no me cabe en la cabeza es como hay mucha gente estadounidense que no sabe que Puerto Rico es parte de USA,he leído cada cosa en las redes,hay demasiada ignorancia.

>  @Edwardskte  Lo dudo. La inemnsa mayoría de las orquestas eran puertorriqueñas-. Los puertorriqueños somos bien alegres y tenemos apertura a distintas manifestaciones de lo musical. Ustedes los que so ajenos a nuestra cultura consumen nuestra cultura, pero no nos entienden en realidad. En Puerto Rico uno puede escuchar lo mismo Pink Floyd que Tego que Frankie Ruiz en el mismo día tranquilamente y luego meterle a Bad Bunny. Eso te hace más rico musicalmente hablando. No entendemos la música desde esos prejuicios clasistas y, dependiendo de la época, racista. Dice César Miguel Rondón que en esos países ajenos a la cultura Antillana, en su caso Venezuela, que la Salsa inicialmente fue rechazada por ser o asociarse con negro y mulatos, la pobreza y la marginalidad. La gente prefería los Beatles. Esto nunca pasó en Puerto Rico, donde mi padre escuchaba The Bee Gees o Air Supply y a la misma vez a Eddie Palmieri. Claro, eventualmente se tuvieron que abrir a la Salsa y del mismo modo con el Reggaetón, pero ningún salser en Puerto percibe o piensa mal del Reggaetón. Esa no es nuestra mentalidad ni apreciación como cultura.

> Te lo diré de esta forma: Soy de los que, cuando escuchó por primera vez a Bad Bunny, decía: "¡Pero qué voz tan fea tiene este tipo! ¡Lo peor que se cree que canta!"; luego comencé a poner atención cuando sacó "Callaita" y "Dakiti" que dije "Bueno, este tipo no tiene la mejor voz, pero algo trae que me atrapa"; ahora con "Un Verano sin ti" me convencí de que el problema no es su voz, el problema es que yo no sabía apreciar su arte. Puedo disfrutar un Da Vinci, un Dalí, un Rembrandt, un Matisse, pero eso no quita que también pueda disfrutar un Pollock, un Miró, algo más abstracto. A la gente le podría parecer que Pollock solo hacía rayones sin sentido, pero ciertamente, su obra, no convencional, es capaz de conectar para quien está abierto a su tipo de arte. Lo mismo creo que podría aplicarse con Bad Bunny: OK, su arte es diferente, no convencional, pero es capaz de conectar, por eso decidí olvidarme de mis prejuicios y aceptar su arte como es y disfrutarlo, así, sin más.

> Music very rarely brings me to tears. I never listened to Bad Bunny before the Superbowl halftime show. Didn't even know he was Puertorican.... With all that said — I have really enjoyed listening to music that I didn't grow up hearing. I'm half Puertorican to an absent father. I don't know what it means to be Puertorican. I can't dance 😓. I'm only fortunate enough to have studied Spanish (Mexican). I can understand some of it but not all of it when he sings but the RHYTHM of the music and the CULTURE portrayed when watching him perform brings out so much emotions within my soul. I want to learn more about Puerto Rico now. I want to go to PR, I want to learn how to Salsa more than ever. This song is so beautiful to me and I cannot stop listening to it. This was my first time watching the music video and it didn't take long for the waterworks to start 😩😭🇵🇷🇺🇲

> Escuto Benito desde quando ele lançou esse álbum e quebrou a bolha chegando no Brasil.
Me interessei por encontrar um latino que chega no nível dos gringos em questão de views, diferente da Shakira e de muitos outros ele segue uma filosofia de falar e cantar no idioma dele
Esse cara e o mais escutado quase todo ano, colecionando Grammys.
Apresentei ele a alguns amigos e todos acharam ele irrelevante, até porque no Brasil escutamos trap,rap,funk,sertanejo,forró,samba tudo feito por nós mesmo.
Porém no evento de futebol Américo a visão deles mudaram, sentiram o mesmo orgulho que eu falava que sentia por ser latino.
A primeira música espanhol que eu escutei foi "Not This América" do Residente...eu não o conhecia mas nessa época eu me interessei pela história da América latina e o YouTube me recomendou esse som.

Como Bailarin y instructor de baile te puedo decir que la cancion tiene tremendo ritmo y soneo para bailarla y gozarla, y tambien quiero agregar que la Salsa fusióna pasión, ritmo, coneccion y cultura es una actividad social que permite y te ayuda a conocer a otras personas, a aprender a expresarte y relacionarte de otro modo y te ayudará a soltarte. Nos permite tomar conciencia de nuestro propio cuerpo, aprender una nueva forma de comunicarnos y expresarnos, por lo que nos permite reforzar y ganar confianza en nosotros mismos. El bailar salsa puede tener muchos beneficios para la salud, como mejorar la flexibilidad, la coordinación, reducir el estrés y controlar el peso. Gracias! Gracias! Gracias! por haber echo esta cancion de Salsa! y ahora a Bailar!!!

So everytime I play this, it’s for those “tough guys” that like to call everyone a snowflake. It’s to watch their ignorant asses MELT DOWN. 😂 they say “I can’t understand” GUESS WHAT tough guy?? I’m a native, lifelong Spanish speaker & I have to listen VERY carefully to understand the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish 😂😂

Nuestra Plena comparte, según los musicólogos cubanos Argeliers León y María Teresa Linares, tiene elementos primigenios con el Son (VÉASE Los Elementos Primigenios del Son), y la Salsa es cómo nosotros cogimos el formato de Son Montuno de Arsenio Rodríguez y lo arreglamos de forma distinta con puentes de ritmos y melodizaciones propias e influencias del Jazz tipo Big Band y el Rythm and Blues y, en el caso de Willie Colón, Roberto Rohena, y La Sonora Ponceña, hasta puentes de Bossa Nova. Yo veo la historia nuestra como la de un hermano menor con un hermano mayor que te enseñó mucho y del que aprendiste para luego tomar rumbo propio. Un abrazo y QUE VIVAN LOS ANTILLANOS.

What got me through the day was your music because now, especially after the Superbowl halftime show, I feel like I'm part of something greater and bigger than myself. Something full of love and care, for ourselves and others. Thank you for your art. We talk about the greats of music, but for me and my generation, Bad Bunny is rey del pop. Thank you for believing in yourself to the point of never giving up on getting your music out there. It gives me hope to not giving up either, even when my life and my work are so much more mundane then an artist's. God bless the Americas, always!! ❤

> Is it just me that gets kinda emotional with this song? It's not romantic for me, I feel a sense of community instead. Like Bella Ciao, it's written like a romantic song for a departing lover but it's bidding farewell to liberty instead.
For me this song feels like a love letter to the community you grew up in, rather than a song for an ex-lover. Although Bunny confirmed the latter.

This is probably also cause I misheard "Solo con usted, con usted // Yo bailo con usted, nada más con usted" as "Soy como usted, como usted // Yo bailo como usted, nadie es como usted". I don't even know if that's grammatically correct, it just made me feel homesick and think of the new places where I found a sense of community and family.

Bad Bunny gave back to our people in a moment when we needed it the most, bridging generational gaps and reminding the world of the beauty of our homeland and culture. He breathed new life into the magic of salsa, creating a timeless anthem that not only celebrates who we are but also unites us. This is more than a song—it’s a gift to Puerto Rico and a reminder of why BB's status as an icon and a genuinely good human being is undeniable.

(If u watched the show in early seasons you would get that part of my comment) It just doesn’t seem like T.S. heart was in this video ….. and during a video that probably cost more than a lot of  films…. Or close too it.  Or maybe she’s just expierenced   humdrum boredom? Or frustration at not doing the video she imagined/ or maybe this is what she imagined…. But it’s one big circus. And not music. Ophelia’s character is epic. I might have to listen to it a few more times. Either way. Whom am I to have an opinion, whom r u. Or u. Or u. To have an opinion. ALL in ALL the video was way way way too busy. To cover up for what seemed like a long chorus. (But whom am I to speak)

> @AK-jw7rx hi I hear you see comment below  from  u/martinooonachef 

"As someone who's deeply in love with English literature, all I can say is: this song is PURE poetry as she reimagines Ophelia’s tragedy not as an ending, but as a resurrection of herself. If we're going back to the Hamlet, Ophelia drowns—lost, silenced, and forgotten. But here? She rose. She’s being pulled out from that melancholy, escaping the grief and chaos Ophelia once drowned into (thanks to Travis and possibly us Swifties who stood by her through heartbreak and healing especially while she was on tour last year:))

Basically, if you're going to ask me, this isn't just a simple pop song, it's an anthem to every person who’s ever felt broken, misunderstood, or silenced, and then eventually found their way back to life, with the help of "someone", or just themselves. Absolute masterpiece. A solid 13/10 "

We needed to grow up, apart, and learn some valuable life lessons. But literally one random Tuesday morning he texted me out of the blue. It had been 12 years since we last saw each other... And just like that, we were back together. And this time for keeps. We've been back together for 6 years now, married 4 of those years. I love him more than I ever even dreamed I ever could love. Everything is so different now from when we were together as kids (we started dating when I was 18). It's not a fairytale romance anymore. It's a real romance. A grown up romance. And I love it. And I am so happy that Taylor has her real, grown up romance now too! ❤️‍🔥

> This is not Ophelia's story. This is Taylor's story. It's about her life, her experiences, her journey.  Seriously, at this point,  some of you are just desperately trying to act/sound so clever and prove that you know Ophelia so much when it is just a song . She made a reference to a well-known story to create this tragic and haunting imagery(drowning), but at the end of the day, she was talking about her OWN life. A man did not save Ophelia, no one said Ophelia needed a man, because the song is not about Ophelia.  Taylor fell in love, and her heart was saved from what she thought  would be a life of loneliness. She believed again. That's it. You just sound ridiculous.

> ​@ihaveanopinion888 Actually, Taylor said her dance team and her band from the eras tour got the music because she  trusted them. But she could not trust all the extra dancers and technicians. So they had only the beat, with no melody.
And it proved she was right, as one of the extra Swedish musicians inadvertently told a friend on social medias he was working on some stuff with Taylor. He then apologized and deleted the tweet. Happily, no clue about TS12 music leaked. 
The production of the whole album is insane. Classic musicians from Swedish orchestras were hired for playing only a few bars. For instance you can hear a flute chiming in for a few seconds.

Visually stunning, emotionally rich — easily my favorite music video of hers, and honestly, maybe of anyone’s. Taylor, radiant and in love, is the version of her that feels most alive. And Travis?

But it's really clever and it's fine to give her credit. People usually have one stereotypical description of what a "showgirl" is. It's not common to see someone defining a showgirl as a woman whose life is used as a form of entertainment for the public instead of just the typical musical dancer type. No one would've thought of Ophelia as one, even though she was a source of gossip and entertainment to the people of Denmark when she went mad, she was a fun show to them

And yet I have a seven year old daughter which means I'm invariably exposed to a pop star like Taylor Swift. And hey, you know what?

I literally like all of her albums, some more than others, but I do like them, and I'm always surprised because, literally, if you listen to her entire discography, she's already covered every musical genre you could possibly hear. That's why people always criticize her by saying, "She doesn't know how to reinvent herself." I mean, they want her to reinvent herself when she's already explored so much. And she always does...

But in the end, she came out on top by finding a guy who really appreciates her instead of just taking advantage of her. This way, she dodged "the fate of Ophelia," who got let down by all the men in her life. Taylor found someone who values her, so she managed to avoid the sad ending that Ophelia had.

Show people cannot take part of the actual party.  The after party is in the video, she walks straight through it to the bath tub.  It’s possibly the hardest part of being a performer, being strong enough to not join the party because you know the next day you have to do it all again.  The people we make the shows for can party with no consequences.

> Thank you so much for sending a comment to Youtube all the way from Brazil(!!!) AND for CARING enuf to mention the Nazis who call themselves ICE..... they are vicious, insane, sadistic torturers........ who enjoy tormenting innocent people. It is a horrifying situation that is taking place all over the USA..... and the most pronounced in Minnesota (Minneapolis especially).   All over the ENTIRE state there are vans, cars, pickup trucks and SUVs driving around with gangs of heavily armed Gestapo agents wearing full face masks, carrying huge guns and cans of pepper spray. IF for ANY reason they decide to stop you in your car, or decide to grab YOU off the street waiting on a bus.... there is NOTHING you can DO!!! They will take you where ever they want, put you in a cage and hold you until THEY decide that you are not an immigrant that they can legally hold. They will not let you call your family or a lawyer, they will not give you your medicines, they will leave your car running in the middle of the street to be stolen or towed. They will take your money, your phone, your ID, EVERYTHING you have on your body..... and NO ONE is allowed to help you! They have kidnapped ANYONE....
 old people, young people, men, women AND kids under 18 ......
 KIDS who are US citizens!!! I am NOT making this up people.... I saw all of these things ON TV on the MSM news..... About 3 weeks ago tRUMP's Gestapo Nazi henchmen went to the home of a Hmong American man (age 57) and went into his house and handcuffed him and TOOK him out of his house (in front of his 5 year old grandson) wearing only boxer shorts and a pair of croc shoes!!! They threw his robe over his shoulders....... (this man had been in the shower....
 they pulled him OUT of the shower!) This man had lived in St. Paul for about 40 years, is a US citizen, had worked with the US military in Laos in the past..... AND is a friend of THE MAYOR OF ST. PAUL (The new mayor of St. Paul is a Hmong lady. You see, the citizens of St. Paul elected an immigrant (or offspring of an immigrant)  as their MAYOR! ...... You see, these people are very open minded......  St. Paul is mostly white people, but they elected the best person for the job.... anyway, it was only 12°F outside when these inhumane torturous members of Satan's army took this elderly man NAKED from his own HOME handcuffed out to their vehicle. It was ALL recorded by MANY cameras..... then they drove around with him in their vehicle for over an hour and then returned him. Their excuse for taking him was that they said he looked like TWO people they were "looking for"...... the two men they were looking for were both about 20 years younger than this man and he did not resemble them in the least..... and he did not even know either of these two men. So, you see, it is a siege!!! These Nazis have been kidnappingcompletely innocent people down in Rochester, Minnesota (about 110 miles south of Minneapolis and St. Paul)... and bringing them up to the Whipple Federal building near the Mall of America. Then after holding them for any amount of time they release them but do NOT provide them with anyway to return to Rochester! So, you see, it is a TOTAL nightmare...... if you happen to be unlucky enuf to have these goons grab you... you are treated less than human. So, thank you very, very much for thinking of us all the way from Brazil.... we appreciate that very much..... all good people must unite and stand up to these Nazis AND tRUMP!!!! (I could go on and on with multiple instances of illegal actions by the Nazis working as ICE under tRUMP's command. tRUMP hates Minnesota becuz we did NOT vote for him, plus becuz we stand up for immigrants in Minnesota. We love immigrants..... we welcome them with open arms...... it does not matter where they are from....
. refugees and people seeking asylum from oppressive regimes in their homeland. I would be that we are the most ethnically diverse state in the entire country.... I kid you not. Whenever we get a paper from a bank or a school or the government telling us something....... they print the message in about 15-20 different languages, becuz we have people here from so many different countries. And even tho' these people are from all over the world, they find homes and jobs and go to work just like everyone else here. Thank you again for caring. It is horrible to see every nite on the news people being pulled over in their cars and 6-8 men surrounding their car with guns pointed at the people in the car..... and if the people in the car don't get out fast enuf they SMASH their car windows with their guns and then drag them out and THROW them on the ground and kneel on their backs and handcuff them and drag them away!!! And NO WARRANTS!!! They say... that they DON'T need a warrant!!! It is all illegal what they do! It is identical to NAZI GERMANY under Adolf Hitler..... which is why we call DJT.... Agolf Shitler (cuz he plays golf). Many people are protesting EVERYDAY!   So much that is happening is downplayed on the news. The news stations feel they must "bow down to the king".

> Letra
¡Nueva York!
Si te quieres divertir
Con encanto y con primor
Solo tienes que vivir (¿a dónde?)
Un verano en Nueva York (¡Nueva York!)
Si te quieres divertir
Con encanto y con primor (¿pero qué es esto?)
Solo tienes que vivir (¿y este frío?)
Un verano en Nueva York (un ratito nada más)
Ey, ey, ey, 4 de julio, fourth of July
Ando con mi prima, borracha, rulay
Los míos en el Bronx saben la que hay
Con la nota en high por Washington Heights
Willie Colón, me dicen el malo, ey
Porque pasan los años y sigo dando palo
Vendiendo discos como cuadro de Frida Kahlo
El perico es blanco, sí, sí
El tusi es rosita, eh-eh
No te confundas, no, no
Mejor evita, ey
Un shot de cañita en casa de Toñita, ay
PR se siente cerquita
Sí, sí, sí
Tengo el campeonato, nadie me lo quita
The best in the world
Number one, the best in the world, okay?
Puerto Rico
¿Cómo Bad Bunny va a ser rey del pop?, ey
Con reguetón y dembow, ey
Con reguetón y dembow, sí
Con reguetón y dembow
¿Cómo Bad Bunny va a ser rey del pop?, ey
Con reguetón y dembow
Me siento como el Lápiz en "Capea el Dough"
Cuando yo nací fue que nació el flow
De lado a lado, ping-pong
Flow pesado, Big Pun
Con silenciador le robamos las gatas
James Bond, ey
Yo estoy en la mía, no tengo adversarios, no
Con los Yankees y los Mets, Juan Soto
A correr, que otra vez la sacamos del estadio
Si te quieres divertir
Con encanto y con primor
Solo tienes que vivir (ya mismo nos vamos)
Un verano en Nueva Y- (un ratito más, un ratito)
Shh, cuidado, que nadie nos escuche
Shh, cuidado, que nadie nos escuche
Shh, cuidado, que nadie nos escuche
Shh, cuida-
Tú tienes piquete, mami, yo también
Tú estás buena, yo estoy bueno también
Huelo rico y ando con los de cien
Si tú los quieres, lo tienes que mover
Tú tienes piquete, mami, yo también
Tú estás buena, yo estoy bueno también
Huelo rico y ando con los de cien
Si tú los quieres, lo tienes que mover
Lo tienes que mover, ve-ve-ve-ve-ve-ve-ve-ve-ve-ve-ve

Si te quieres divertir
Con encanto y con primor
Solo tienes que vivir (¿a dónde?)
Un verano en Nueva York (¡Nueva York!)

Si te quieres divertir
Con encanto y con primor (¿pero qué es esto?)
Solo tienes que vivir (¿y este frío?)
Un verano en Nueva York (un ratito nada más)

Ey, ey, ey, 4 de julio, fourth of July
Ando con mi prima, borracha, rulay
Los míos en el Bronx saben la que hay
Con la nota en high por Washington Heights
Willie Colón, me dicen el malo, ey
Porque pasan los años y sigo dando palo
Vendiendo discos como cuadro de Frida Kahlo

El perico es blanco, sí, sí
El tusi es rosita, eh-eh
No te confundas, no, no
Mejor evita, ey

Un shot de cañita en casa de Toñita, ay
PR se siente cerquita
Sí, sí, sí
Tengo el campeonato, nadie me lo quita

The best in the world
Number one, the best in the world, okay?

> Mi comentario es una gota en el mar, me agrada mucho Benito, me agrada mucho su superación personal,  y que difunda un mensaje positivo. 

Lo descubrí por la WWE y por ello me parece una persona versátil y agradable.  Aplausos que no sea homofóbico ( ver video: "yo perreo sola"), pero no me agrada que pudiera confundir a gente que apenas esta en desarrollo, gente de 15-20  años.   

Aplausos para Benito y que siempre siga con muchos éxitos.  ¡Arriba Puerto Rico también!.   Como dirían en PR, "sin embalgo..... sin embalgo....." en lo que respecta a música....,  y no lo digo por las secuencias y beats excelentes,  buen ritmo,  e instrumentos latinos reales mis respetos a toda la música instrumental latina hermosa,  mis respetos a los músicos........ pero......"sin embalgo"...  el sonido que emite.... al "cantal".....balbucear..... es una TOTAL y reverenda ....Miel-da. Jamás he aborrecido a Bad Bunny como tú, pero lo del balbuceo es una Miel-da.  Bien secuenciada y rítmica, que despierta el instinto primate, sin duda. "Efecto Labubu".

No sorprende que a millones les agrade ya que es un reflejó de la cultura y educación.  Lo mismo del lado inverso del que se copia/inspira como MIGOS, Drake, Malone, etc.  Qué en apariencia no son "criticados" por su "origen".......pero el desarrollo del balbuceado/"Mumble".... igual "total miel-DA " dentro de la gente de baja "cultula".  Tengo mi gusto culposo ya que me agrada la música de Malone.

Su mensaje sobre "Debí tirar más fotos". Emotivo. Muy lindo.   Irónicamente, y ahora baja cultura de mi parte, cito a "Optimus Prime", y envío este mensaje a cualquier Autobot sobreviviente (músicos) que se refugien entre las estrellas. Estamos aquí y estamos esperando"........¿esperando qué?......buena música... creada por artistas como los que han ayudado a Benito @BadBunnyPR a ser quien es hoy.  Qué sigan los éxitos para Benito!

> Bad bunny half time set idea - the set itself is set in New York streets, buildings and such (to foreshadow later)
The set starts with something slow but also to foreshadow the ending it starts with a “shh” from this song it’s dark and then followed by a pause… about 3-4 seconds to have people think it’s going to start with nuevayol but nope.
It starts with “titi me pregunto si tengo mucha novia” and goes into that song for a bit… lights dancing the works

Then transitions to other bops until the final song… this one nuevayol

After the dancing and such stops from the previous song they are tired from getting down and sit at a little table outside of a window like at a NY cafe and look at the center of the table. In the center there’s a radio. The iconic radio static starts the camera starts to slowly zoom toward the radios in the center and then boom the moment we’re waiting for …. on plays the “Trump apology impression” (#freedomofspeech)

Idk if it’s good but to me it gave me goose bumps…. Especially with our people being mistreated of all melanated kinds. We do not choose our skin color or race so why are we being punished. We are living in the same earth so why do borders matter. No one ever owns the property or people because we all live and we all go the same 💀. We only live once and we should focus on bettering us all to prosper on this world while we’re here. Why dedicate your time to hurting others. If you’re still reading this far please be kind. Please help those around you who need it. We are all human. We might be physically different but we’re all internally similar if not the same. Spread love not hate. We are all worthy of happiness. Live and let live as long as no harm is done. Thank you for your time and I hope you have a beautiful and wonderful day/life! 🌸

>  @JoeEsser-bg6xy it's not about politics, it's about music. Take church for instance, let's go Catholic!  How many hymns are in Latin? Now how many white Americans sing these hymns yet cannot translate word for word what it says in English? Think of food menus. How many people order a food by a word or name yet don't know what that means in it's own native tongue? It's not just Spanish, Mexican, Scottish, African, Japanese- all experience exceeds language. If you bow to someone after a kindness, no word is necessary- you know what that means. Music can be the same- why must life in general be political when it's not what you eat, breathe, and flows thru your body? Keep labels to personal preferences.

I choose enjoying life. And I'm a white woman myself, so please don't go there. I'm just not blind to others and appreciate everything and everyone equally. That's my preference, my choice, my own identity which I do not expect others to have and respect anyone's decision to be otherwise. (I just don't and won't condone being picky for no reason from my end.)💜

O mundo anda muito chato. Parece que o dono da bola do mundo não quer nos  permitir divertir. Você é incrível. Deu uma vontade danada de ser seu amigo. De te conhecer. Você tem muito axé. MUITO.  Basta prestar atenção em você. Na sua arte. Nas mensagens que você está enviando ao mundo... Chegou aqui: Bairro Saudade, Minas Gerais, Brasil ❤ A gente sabe... A salvação é pela arte. Música é um remédio para a alma. A dança é o mistério do corpo. Não era música, é vida. Sou um garoto pobre da periferia que aos quase 50 anos cheguei aqui e recebi uma alegria, uma emoção de ainda estar aqui. Nesse, NOSSO mundo que anda chato Mas você me convida para diversão. Muito obrigado, eu não sei muito bem explicar: a sua arte me provoca. Que bom encontrar com o seu trabalho. Sua arte. Que luz você traz para este nosso mundo escuro.

> Yo detestaba la música basura de Bad Bunny como Safaera y no lo consideraba cantante, aún no lo considero  cantante verdadero porque no canta como Luis Miguel pero el tipo tiene algo especial  pues millones lo siguen  analizando sus últimos dos discos, son una obra de arte, en este segundo albúm la mezcla de salsa, pop, rap no es solo reggagetón, Bad Bunny esta saliendo de su zona de cofort y esta atreviendose a hacer algo muy diferente a todo lo que estan haciendo los demás. Muy buen disco el último,  el show que hizo en el super bowl fue espectacular, a mi me gustó apartir de alli cambió mi opinión el tipo es un show man es artista, con unas clases de canto puede mejorar pero es muy creativo,  es Madonna pero en masculino y Latino, en el sentido de que sabe como manejar el escandalo y sabe manejar el negocio de la música, eso no cualquiera lo logra a mi me gusta esta canción jajajajja

Así que conoci un poco de la história de la salsa por Joe Arroyo y después, por Héctor Lavoe, Willie Colón, Ray Barretto, Cheo Feliciano, Roberto Roena, Bobby Valentín e Ismael Rivera. Así que conocí la história del Harlen y me encantó la comunidad. Amo Puerto Rico por muchas cosas. No conozco USA, tampoco Puerto Rico personalmente. Pero in USA, me encanta la comunidade latina y la efervescencia cultural con todos los imigrantes en Harlen. Deseo que algún dia Puerto Rico pueda libertarse como nación y que USA pueda respetar a los latinos y todos los pueblos indígenas y de otros países que construyen el pais. USA tierra de los imigrantes. Tierra robada de los indígenas.

> Please dont wrestle for the WWE again. Please don't throw away everything you just stood for and represented just for the paycheck. The WWE is a vile organize that doesn't care about our people, they use us for profit. They support Trump, are connected with Linda McMahon, who has ruined latino childrens' chances at quality education in the U.S. and take Saudi Blood money. Keep standing up for the people that love you and your message, not for the company that helps contribute to the downfall of our people. Don't wrestle Logan Paul, I thought he was one of the rich Americans privatizing Puerto Rican land, taking public land from native boricuas and putting up fences. I thought you stood against that, dont help him make more money off your back. Please, remember what you really stand for. Latinos unidos🇵🇪🇵🇷

Mejor ser besado por su boquita, amor
Las tentaciones, así como tú
Merecen pecados como yo
Ay, si tú quieres, solo da la lu' (yeh-yeh)
Tú sabes que no vo'a a decir que no
Ay, tienes la magia, tú sí tienes una vainita
Que a mí me encanta, me enloquece (alright)

Siento que te pasa lo mismo cuando te miro
¿Qué dices si nos parchamos a ver el amanecer? (¡Prr, uh!)
Quiero ser tu todo, quiero que tú seas mi toa
Le digo: "Soft low", y luego viene y me lo soba (¡uah!)
Vamo'a vernos luego, si no te gusta el infierno
¿Pa qué vienes al diablo y lo emboba'?
Ella parcerita paisa, y yo costeño coleto
En una baldosa la aprieto
Pa hablarte claro, cero visaje

JESÚS entregó su vida por amor a ti; para limpiarte, para hacerte libre y darte vida ETERNA junto a Él. Sufrió por tu pecado el dolor y castigo que tú merecías en una cruz. Al tercer día resucitó y vuelve pronto a juzgar la Tierra. Está avisando. Por eso... ARREPIÉNTETE y conócelo antes que sea demasiado tarde, para que no tengas que pasar el resto de la eternidad atormentado en la más profunda y oscura soledad. Porque Dios odia el pecado.

Es impresionante cómo la canción captura esa emoción pura, esa atracción que nace desde lo más profundo del ser. Cada verso es como un suspiro, reflejando la forma en que nos cautiva alguien no solo por su físico, sino por su esencia y manera de ser. Es un recordatorio de que el amor va más allá de lo visible; está en los gestos, las miradas, en todo lo que no se dice pero se siente.🔥🔥

> A mí esta y la de Valka fueron las únicas que me gustaron tanto de entrada, la de Blessd no me gustó, la de Ryan sii, pero después me encantó soltera, aunque no pa ponerla tanto como he puesto ésta, es que está mucho mejor hecha, y no es comercial como soltera.

>  @deimontrek se llama historia y contexto cultural, lo que crees que son tus valores puristas presuntamente mejor que el de los demás, solo es una imposición de la estética “vanguardista” de occidente medio, Europa y sus vueltas aparentemente elitistas.

Este tema por otra parte, encarna la historia de algo que empezó en las calles, de una sociedad, como el rap en New York que ganó grammy y tiene su propia estatuilla; también darle un grammy a este tema es representar la cultura latina y caribeña, una sociedad que en el mainstream nunca se les ha visibilizado si no es con el canon estético europeo donde todo tiene que ser en inglés o europeo para ser vanguardista. Quítate ese velo pa, que tú también haces parte de la historia de este tema pues contigo van las raíces de aquellas tribus africanas que crearon los primeros sonidos de la historia, especialmente el bum bap de esa canción.

Realiza que eres un grano de arena en la historia que debe manifestar y representar esta canción más allá de lo superficial que lo ves, hay peores canciones en inglés que solo por ser en inglés son “mejores” aparentemente. Viva DTMF y viva la historia que trama y el viaje que te lleva desde sonidos caribeños a sonidos africanos y producción vanguardista. El mejor Benito.

> The layers— you don’t have to be fluent in Spanish to feel it. The sound alone took me on a journey, and I could recognize elements from salsa classics and the greats. Growing up surrounded by different flavors of Latin and Spanish music, it felt familiar yet new. You can tell it’s a mashup of cultures just from the sound itself. The live orchestra touches in the music brought such richness, just like this reggaeton beat. Bad Bunny really went back to his origins with this one—it’s rooted in so much tradition. I’m not even from the culture but as a mixed race Canadian with South American/ West Indian background oh I noticed and appreciate it. Sadly, the masses with limited  attention spans, lol  won’t see the genius of this album. The more it’s played and talked about then folks will take their time to see it & feel it.

> English translation of slide:

Repression and Surveillance in Puerto Rico (1960s-1980s)

On March 4, 1970, Puerto Rican police shot and killed student Antonia Martínez Lagares as she stood on a balcony amid clashes between students and police in the streets of Río Piedras. Her name was immortalized in the song "Antonia, Your Name Is History" by Antonio Cabán Vale, "El Topo" (The Mole).

Her face can still be seen painted on the walls of the urban center of the university town of Río Piedras.

Students were not the only ones who mobilized. Poor and working-class people also took to the streets, occupying land to build their humble homes. Communities like Villa Cañona and Villa Sin Miedo (Villa Without Fear) were created through land occupations.

One case that captured national attention was that of Adolfina Villanueva.

> No puedes comparar la trayectoria de Dj/Productor con la de un cantante son diferentes tiempos, Cuando lanzaron Los Benjamins (Más Flow 3) allá por el 2005 Luny Tunes presentaron oficialmente a Tainy, Yankee, Wisin y Yandel ya llevaban como 15 años en el reggaetón (ósea a comienzos de los 90), digo agradezco el reconocimiento que le das a Tainy porque para mi es uno de mis mejores productores de Reggaetón por todos los tiempos junto con Dj Nelson, Dj Urba y Monserrate, Noriega, Luny Tunes , Diésel , Mr G, Eliel el que habla con las manos, Nesty, Víctor el Nazi, etc. Pero como tepito no lo puedes comparar con los cantantes porque como dice un comentario arriba es más desgaste para el cantante, sin embargo que viva el reggaetón por todos los tiempos y que nos dure el Grand Marcos Masis Aka Tainy ❤❤❤

> Te creo, se debe poner en el pedestal del género, pero debajo de Luny, Tunes, Nelly, Nesty, DJ Nelson. Tainy gana mayor reconocimiento ahora, gracias a que el género urbano explotó a nivel mundial, no únicamente en Latinoamérica. Además, este estilo de Reggaeton Latino (como la canción de DO), es el propio, con esa instrumental y arreglos musicales que se sienten latinos. A diferencia de otras producciones de Tainy, donde mezcla el reggaeton con géneros principalmente anglos, DnB/electrónica, como lo hizo en Data, que a mí parecer, poco tiene que ver con nuestra cultura latina. Cualquier canción de Tainy Tunes, su misma "Ven Pégate" de Sangre Nueva, me parece lejos mejor que cualquier neo reggaeton de Data.

El "hubiera" es para situasiones hipoteticas en el pasado que ya no pueden cambiarse, o sea literalmente tu caso... Ademas de que solo tienes que decirlo tu mismo para comprobar que suena raro si eso ya pasó, en cambio el "fuera" es para situaciones tambien hipoteticas pero en el futuro, o sea que no han sucedido. 

Otro error común que he visto en el internet es que dicen "musicas" y esa palabra literalmente no existe en el español, para eso está la palabra "canciones". Pero bueh, uno intenta ayudar y se ofenden como niñitas inmaduras, así que espero que ese no sea tu caso.

En la transición, el flow es homenaje a los coros altos con reverb de Tito El Bambino, Baby Rasta o incluso Yandel, y del 1:29 en adelante la pista es una combinación de diferentes canciones de 2002-2003, como "Si Estoy Fácil" de Héctor y Tito, y un par de elementos de "Es Mejor Olvidarlo" de Zion, Lennox y Baby Ranks.

Blin Blin Vol 1 y Guatauba Triple X tienen exactamente este tipo de pistas

> For the English ppls. This is old school reggaeton from the ‘90s-00’s. Straight from PR with a producer from the era, Tiny Tunes. This song samples a mixture of melodies from Hector y Tito’s ‘Si Estoy Fácil’ and ‘Baila Morena’. These melodies using synth pops, made popular by the legendary producers Luney Tunes, were very popular at the time and in my opinion the best era of reggaeton. Thank you #badbunny

> found out how to stream bts songs on youtube from a video so i thought to share it, for peoples who don't know how to stream :

1. Use search bar - Always search for the MV manually. Don't click on links!

2. Watch the FULL MV - Don't skip or fast-forward.

3. Watch in 480p or higher with sound ON.

4. Log in to your account - Views only count when you're signed in.

5. Watch different videos in between - Avoid looping just one video. Watch other BTS content or take breaks.

6. Like, comment, and share! Engagement boosts visibility.

what we SHOULDN'T DO

1. DON'T mute the video. (Use low volume instead)

2. DON'T use incognito mode.

3. DON'T refresh or replay continuously. It may not count as a new view.

4. DON'T skip ads. If you can, let them play.

5. DON'T run multiple tabs or devices at once with the same account. 

BONUS :
1) Use multiple devices/accounts if you can

2) Clear watch history or log out and in after a few hours

3) Use playlists smartly: mix MVs, live stages, and interviews

i even asked one of my friends who works at youtube just to double-check, and he literally confirmed that they don’t do that. views might freeze cuz of system checks or suspected spam activity but not cuz someone dropped a couple emojis in the comments section, come on now!!!

so pls stop spreading this kinda misinterpreted stuff especially armys. don’t fall for every random thing you read in the comments...check facts first!
(From now on im just gonna copy-paste this everywhere if i see anyone stopping someone from using emojis! like it's just emojis...not the end of the world. views will only increase if y’all actually stream, not just because someone wanted to comment under their fave's music video with an emoji to show love)

I’ve been into this situationship that became an almost. It doesn’t actually meant to end but with some circumstances we had to end it. 

I know we feel the same way for each other but there’s always something the stops us everytime we meet unexpectedly. 

The lyrics “Faking a smile while we're breaking apart
Oh, I never, never, never meant to take it this far
Too late to save me, so don't even start
Oh, you never meant to hurt me but you're making it hard”  this is the exact same situation that we have. 

I just wish that we hated each other instead of ending it nicely. I wish we had just done that so both of us will never have this “what ifs” in our hearts like we have now. It’s been almost 2 years

Just make sure the playlist you use follows the str3aming guidelines…at least 3 mvs in between main focus mv, and the 3 are not repeated to avoid str3aming patterns. You also still have to interact with a playlist …leave a comment or like someone’s comment every few mvs. If you don’t have premium YT, you will still get ads with playlists…don’t skip them. 
You can str3am for hours using the 1 account, just take a small break every few hours, and str3am correctly ( in that break time you could then str3am from another platform like Spotify)

> Just like ​ @Nadralalah  said. Maybe running implies that he is moving towards his future. But not just walking, striding; he is running. He knows what awaits for him is something maybe he always wanted and he is not scared anymore because he has us. He has us, we have him (& BTS). So, he is running like crazy. He is running to become what he always wanted to become, to show what he always wanted to show, to feel, to comfort and much much more. Maybe running also implies that at the end of his road, we are standing there waiting for him. And his actual goal is to reach us. But, it's all a theory so anyways.

> @HappyEchoworld-h7i  Happy. You are giving out ridiculous instructions with no factual basis.  YouTube FREEZES views regularly to check for bot-like, tricky behaviors, like replays, playlists, multiple tabs playing, no volume, etc. Invalid views are then DELETED.
 The valid views that look like a person is choosing and watching an mv are returned to the count. 
       They SUPPLY EMOJIS for reasonable use that is not childish and annoying and junking up the COMMENT section. Why would they penalize something they supply?

> 😢😭😥🤧I completely agree! Jin is not only an incredible artist who deserves respect and love. Collaborations and interactions with other artists are part of his creativity. As an ARMY, our role is to support him wholeheartedly without judgment or negativity. But I won’t lie, seeing him with another woman does hurt 💔 because he means so much to me. Honestly, it breaks my heart a little to see Jin with someone else 😞. Even though it’s hard, I want to support him and respect his choices because that’s what true love is.😥🤧

Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers and sisters at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have died. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.

Please enjoy our boys and their songs. You will find that their songs hit different and have a deep meaning that hits all ages, races, and genders. They are also great people who show by example how to treat each other. I hope you are able to find comfort from their songs just as the rest of us have.

> Jin’s voice carries so much emotion, it feels like he’s pouring his heart into every word. 'Don’t Say You Love Me' isn’t just a breakup song it’s about the pain of holding on when love starts slipping away. The MV felt like a K-drama that hit way too close to home. That reunion with Shin Se-Kyung? My heart shattered. Jin never fails to tell a story that lingers even after the music stops. Welcome back, Seokjin we missed you more than words can say!!

     What gets a person's views deleted is bot-like, tricks to increase views, like replays, playlists, multiple tabs playing, etc.

> I earned the right to talk this way
Ain't no one gonna make me change
I earned the right to say
"I'm the shit, so shout my name"
I earned the right to walk this way
Look and the god damn life I made
But you don't know the price I paid
I've done my time in the gutter, gutter
Ain't bowing down to another, another
Breaking through all the smoke screens you put up
Ooh, back then we were so good
Don't you smile in my face
'Cause the words that you said
Feel like a gun to my head
I'm through
Paid my price, sacrificed for you
I ain't here 'cause you saved my life
The words that you said
Feel like a gun to my head
Feel like a gun to my head
Feel like a gun to my head
I earned my right to fight this way
Was misunderstood and underpaid
I licked the dust and liked the taste
Ooh, back then we were so good
Don't you smile in my face
'Cause the words that you said
Feel like a gun to my head
I'm through
Paid my price, sacrificed for you
I ain't here 'cause you saved my life
The words that you said
Feel like a gun to my head
I've done my time in the gutter, gutter
I ain't bowing down to another, another
Breaking through all the smoke screens you put up
I'm through

> Bad Bunny es más que un artista, es un embajador de Puerto Rico en el mundo. Su amor por la isla se siente en cada verso, cada acción y cada paso que da. Benito lleva a su tierra en el corazón, y lo demuestra al hablar con orgullo de sus raíces, al destacar la belleza de su cultura y alzar la voz por las injusticias que afectan a su gente.

En sus canciones, Puerto Rico no es solo un lugar, es un personaje, una fuente de inspiración, una causa que defiende. Desde las vibrantes playas hasta los retos que enfrenta el pueblo, Bad Bunny transforma todo lo que representa a la isla en arte. Su música es un puente entre la tradición y la modernidad, una celebración de lo que significa ser boricua.

Más allá de las palabras, su amor se traduce en: marchando junto a su gente, ayudando en momentos de crisis, y utilizando su plataforma global para recordar al mundo que Puerto Rico está lleno de fuerza, esperanza y resiliencia.

Bad Bunny nos enseña que amar a tu país no es solo decirlo, es vivirlo, y él lo hace con cada nota, con cada gesto, y con cada grito de “¡Yo soy de Puerto Rico!”.

No digo que toda su música tenga que pasar por un filtro cultural o de letras más positivas para la juventud, pero es difícil aceptar que este tipo de artistas llene estadios y que toda una generación de jovenes, sin las ideas muy claras, lo tengan como un ídolo. No pretendo crear disputa, solo que os cuestiones la calidad de lo que considerais buena música.

> 2026!
Aqui venho compartilhar um dos meus grandes aprendizados de 2025, talvez o mais dolorido da minha vida… ah o amor… se eu soubesse talvez nunca teria tentado amar novamente.

Eu não sei se um dia você vai parar pra pensar no que aconteceu entre nós, mas eu preciso dizer o que ficou guardado aqui dentro.
Eu tentei estar presente, tentei entender, tentei ser leve. E mesmo quando comecei a sentir algo a mais, nunca te pressionei — só quis que você percebesse o carinho e a sinceridade com que eu te via.
Quando as coisas mudaram, eu ainda acreditei na amizade que a gente construiu. Só que o silêncio, a distância e o bloqueio mostraram que talvez essa amizade fosse mais minha do que sua.
E, sabe, eu não te culpo por não sentir o mesmo. O que me decepciona é a maneira como você lidou com tudo — como se nada tivesse existido, como se dois anos pudessem simplesmente desaparecer.
Eu não entendo completamente os teus atos, e talvez nem precise. Às vezes, as
pessoas se afastam não porque deixaram de se importar, mas porque não sabem lidar com o que sentem.
Eu sigo sem raiva, sem mágoa — apenas com o aprendizado de que nem todo mundo vai retribuir na mesma medida aquilo que a gente entrega de coração.
Eu só espero que, um dia, você aprenda a lidar com as pessoas que te querem bem
sem precisar machucá-las pra se proteger.
Eu sigo em paz. Porque, mesmo sem entender você, eu entendo o que eu vivi — e isso já é o bastante.

Esse texto só eu vou ser capaz de entender e, talvez, ela… mas nunca chegará nela não é mesmo?

Amor, posso dizer que nessa vida já amei depois desse 2025, não cheguei a convidá-la pra sair, fiquei a milímetros de fazer isso, fiquei há algumas cordas vocais de dizer pra ela… mas por alguma força maior não tive coragem de chamá-la e talvez isso tenha sido bom ou ruim… fato é que após isso e essa confusão toda  só me provou que ela não tinha os mesmos olhos por mim que tinha por ela, chamaria isso de friendzone? Eu entendo a dor de vários que estão por aqui solteiros após relações que não entendemos como e por que terminaram.

Mas mesmo assim, estou tentado seguir em frente a cada dia, porque o amor que eu senti era verdadeiro e sou humano como qualquer um de vocês… ela nem sabe o quanto guardei para comprar um futuro anel nosso de namoro, flores, tantos planos… Mas posso dizer que senti o que é amar e mesmo que a caminhada solitária demore até terminar, sigo vivendo cada dia como se fosse o último, quer alguém esteja do meu lado, quer sozinho… 

Obrigado por ler essas palavras que escrevi nessa noite, do mais profundo coração, desejo que tenha um ótimo dia ou tarde ou noite, de onde quer que esteja lendo. 

Sigo buscando ser feliz. Obrigado.

> The song opens with a soft, melodic introduction that sets a contemplative mood. 

The first verse introduces the idea of shedding layers, both literally and metaphorically. 

The lyrics suggest a desire to be seen for who one truly is, beyond the facades that people often present to the world. 

This theme of vulnerability is a recurring motif throughout the song, as the narrator expresses a longing for genuine connection.


As the chorus hits, the repetition of the phrase "undressed" emphasizes the act of revealing oneself, not just physically but emotionally. 

This moment serves as a powerful declaration of the narrator's willingness to be open and honest, inviting the listener to consider their own experiences with intimacy. 

The use of vivid imagery in the lyrics paints a picture of a relationship where both parties are encouraged to let go of their insecurities and embrace their true selves.
In the second verse, the song delves deeper into the complexities of love and attraction. 

The lyrics reflect on the push and pull of desire, highlighting the tension that often exists in romantic relationships. 

The narrator grapples with feelings of fear and excitement, illustrating the duality of wanting to be close to someone while also fearing the potential for heartbreak. 

This internal conflict resonates with many listeners, as it captures the essence of modern love.
The bridge of the song introduces a moment of introspection, where the narrator questions their own motivations and desires. 

This section adds depth to the narrative, as it reveals the struggle between wanting to be vulnerable and the fear of being hurt. 

The lyrics here are poignant, showcasing Sombr's ability to articulate complex emotions in a relatable way.
As the song progresses towards its conclusion, the repetition of the chorus reinforces the central theme of vulnerability. 

The final lines echo a sense of acceptance, suggesting that while being "undressed" can be daunting, it is also a necessary step towards forming meaningful connections. 

The song ends on a reflective note, leaving listeners with a sense of hope and the understanding that true intimacy requires courage and authenticity.

And have to pretend it's yours instead

I don't wanna get undressed
For a new person all over again.

> You had a dream, you wanted better
You were sick of all the holes in your sweater
You looked to me and wondered whether
I was the lamppost to which you were tethered

I'm lookin' at you, and you're lookin' at me
But the glimmer in your eyes is sayin' you wanna leave
You say you don't mean what you're sayin' to me
But the glimmer in your eyes is telling me other things

I don't wanna get undressed
For a new person all over again
I don't wanna kiss someone else's neck
And have to pretend it's yours instead

I took the train to see my mother
I look across the tracks to see you with another
There's nothin' worse than seein' your lover
Moving on while you still suffer

I'm lookin' at you, and you're lookin' at me

> @aei aei - Oh, please, just try having a genuine and true thought. Nobody is being victimized here. It's a musical story of someone who wishes he could see her and his eyes in kids they had together. But that lyric doesn't hurt. The character is trying to avoid pain, so the lyrics have to flip what he wants to have to what he doesn't want. That's Story Writing 101. And the sensible contrapositive of that is NOT wanting to see someone else's eyes in her kids. So, for crissake, grow up! You sound like a young adult whose pathetically-limited mind heard a novel idea of "toxic masculinuty" and now thinks the whole world must be seen through that lens, like people who learn about Freud and then think everything is about sex. One day, even without trying, you're going to grow bored - even sick and tired - of your overwrought, self-righteous anger. For the rest of us hearing the likes of you, that day can't come soon enough.

> Uma vez amei um garoto, eu tinha acabado de fazer 15 anos e ele tinha 18, ele foi meu primeiro amor, eu era loucamente apaixonada por ele, porem eu não sabia muita coisa, eu era inocente.
Ele me ensinou várias coisas, eu digo que amadureci com a ajuda dele, cresci pq ele me ajudou a crescer.
Mas meus pais não aceitaram ele e isso abalou nós dois, até que uma noite ele decidiu me deixar, nenhuma explicação, apenas com um texto.
Meu mundo tinha acabado, e piorou mais pq eu descobri que ele me difamava, eu o amava com a alma e não teria nada que faria eu o odiar. 
Eu escuta essa música e pensava" ele é o amor da minha vida, e eu não posso deixá-lo ir". Mas lembre, se você acabar segurando muito alguém, você pode a acabar perdendo você mesma. 
Eu ainda espero um pedido de desculpas por tudo, mas sei que isso nunca vai acontecer

> The entire image of the "reserved modern boy with feelings" is tired. I get what hes saying, but hes making his target audience incels. Great song if you can get past the semantic noise it creates. This to me implies, the only reason hes not a Netflix star is because he can't act. Otherwise he'd fit the image perfectly.
For example, country music will tell you the country men can be the best kind of man you'd ever meet. I have yet to meet a single man in cowboy boots that i had any kind of respect for. Its all packaging something unfamiliar to you, and finding a way to get you to buy it. There is NO WAY this guy actually cares about who hes sleeping with, he just doesn't want to deal with heartbreak like anyone. Fake exclusivity at its finest.

OMG I still love that girl in my dreams at least & someday she will have kids with another man that was supposed to be me. And tmher kids are going to be the eyes of the girl I still, on some level of my conscience, feel that way for, mixed with another guy. I know the guy ,& he's a total dork. I don't hate him or anything. I'm actually rooting for him to be a better man than I actually think he probably is, for as healthy as that is. But my God. That nerd is going to combine genetics with the girl that my subconscious still loves. 
Or at least that's what my dreams tell me. I feel nothing when I'm awake.

Well many of us know exactly how that feels, and great art does often come thru intense heartbreak. Great songs, amazing performer. He will be inundated with women now… question is, who will be worthy? Whoever that woman was that spurned him onto writing all these great songs and lyrics, wow… she REALLY broke his heart bad. I wonder if she knows? Sad to say, while we will hopefully get more great songs from this guy, he’s so young that he will experience plenty more heartbreak in his life. That’s just how it goes.

> It's wild when you see--in 2025--a young man so effortlessly built to be a superstar in the 80s New Wave era.  I'm old enough to remember when guys like Dave Gahan, Bernard Sumner, Howard Jones, etcetera who just had that "it" factor that told you they were gonna be around for the long haul.  I love the fact that Sombr is blowing up and tapping into a defining genre of music, that while all his own, is also a love letter to that classic 80s sound.  It takes a hell of an artist to have the look AND be able to back it up musically.  Wishing you nothing but greatness, Sombr.

Yes, we're happy that he's getting the attention he deserves, but some of us have been listening to him since he was really underground and no one knew about him or his music. So yeah it's a little bittersweet when something that was unheard of was kinda like you're little secret and then everyone else finds out. It doesn't mean that we are mad or upset that hes popular it's just there was a time when it felt like a special secret that only a few people were really big fans so calm downnn

> Man I Need

Song by Olivia Dean ‧ 2025

Lyrics

Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me
Hm

Looks like we're making up for lost time
Need you to spell it out for me
Bossa Nova on all night
It's like a type of alchemy
Introduce me to your best friend
I can come and slot right in
A satellite ain't even that far
I, I kinda wonder where you are

Already know I can't leave it alone
You're on my mind, mm
Already gave you the time and the place
So, don't be shy

Just come be the man I need
Tell me you got something to give, I want it
I kinda like it when you call me wonderful
Whatever the type of talk it is, come on then
I gotta know you're meant to be the man I need
Talk to me
Talk to me

Mm, talk to me, talk to me
Be the man that I need, baby
Talk to me, talk to me
Be the man that I need, need, need
Mm, talk to me, talk to me
Be the man that I need, baby
Talk to me, talk to me
Be the man, man, man, man, man

I'd like to think you feel the same way
But I can't tell with you sometimes
So, baby, let's get on the same page
Stop making me read between the lines

Already know I can't leave it alone
You're on my mind, mm
Already gave you the time and the place
So, don't be shy

Just come be the man I need
Tell me you got something to give, I want it
I kinda like it when you call me wonderful
Whatever the type of talk it is, come on then
I gotta know you're meant to be the man I need
Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me

Mm, talk to me, talk to me
Be the man that I need, baby (be the man)
Talk to me, talk to me
Be the man that I need, need, need
Mm, talk to me, talk to me
Be the man that I need, baby (be the man)
Talk to me, talk to me
Be the man, man, man, man, man

> I've been doin' some thankin' about why this song hits so hard, and I think there's a subtle redefinition in it that is desperately needed but isn't ever asked for. The man she needs is one who can and will talk to her. She doesn't praise boldness here, but instead connection and communication. She wants to meet his best friend, she wonders where he is; this isn't about someone who's pushing in to talk to her, but instead someone who follows her invitation.
This is a redefinition of what is desirable. She doesn't talk about appearance or prowess or power in any way, but instead the ability to communicate. It's an intimate and gentle invitation to become close through words, because she wants that and that's what the man she needs will do.
Which is also a redefinition of desirable masculinity. The Man doesn't take her, he talks to her. She literally says be the man man man man here and it's really hard to miss it.
The reason it feels so warm isn't just because of how its musically crafted, although that's a big part of it for sure. I think it's also using female agency to define desirability in a way that's kind, good, and inherently intimate.

> Born here in 2005.
Thank you, Olivia, for releasing this genre of music, the kind I somehow missed growing up.
Sometimes I wish we could go back in time for a moment, just briefly, without phones, without social pressure, before we became so self-focused.

But at the same time, I now also have the right to love.
I hope I meet the boy of my life soon.
So that we can hold each other’s hands, dance together when this song starts, steal a kiss now and then, and enjoy Olivia’s voice side by side.

I also hope that decades from now, this song will have become a golden classic of the 2020s, and that when we’re older together, we’ll still dance to it, reliving the same moment, thinking: this is our song.

This is always what goes through my mind when I listen to this song.
I hope you keep making music like this. 🫶

> He looks great! Though not to to sound rude, but he does look a little plain in my opinion. Might I suggest some form of small pupils like white or red rings in the eyes to make it appear that something is in the skin. Perhaps also make the rows of teeth smaller with lots of space around the sides and a more blank expression. Maybe some rips along the torso or arms but all you can see through the rips is a dark void?

Either way, I think it looks great. I like when people branch their EXEs to different characters besides Sonic. Sonic as an EXE is way overdone in my opinion. It’s refreshing to see Tails as an EXE.

You did a great job in my opinion.

> I used to listen to this song when I had a crush on this guy. He lives really far away, so because of the whole LDR thing, we couldn’t date. We had so much in common, and over time we started bonding really deeply. I was genuinely attracted to him...he was handsome, at least to me. We don’t talk anymore because I ended up really loving him. So every time I listen to this song, I get transported back to that phase of my life when I was slowly falling in love with him. It’s crazy how songs can make you time-travel like that. It’s actually nice to relive those moments. He’s a good guy, and I really hope he finds someone great.

> They're quite a few these days.  In the 10th anniversary of "the Artist's passing" (Prince), I know he must be elated to see the emergence of "real music."  Some even have elements that suggest they had been exposed to Prince's genius.  I celebrate these fabulous singers and the 10th year of Prince's passing.  We know he's busy behind the scenes guiding these young artists...  The industry tries to erase Prince's genius as they do with all black music of our past.  They just don't play it.  It's great to see that these artists have played it. Not for nothing, these British acts are still popping off the charts!

I'm quite grown up actually (will be a proper grown up of 62 this year 😂) and absolutely love jazz, bossa nova, rap, etc. I think Lola Young is fabulous, grew up on motown, Amy Winehouse is my hero. But find this a bit bland. I must admit I find Adele a bit bland too. Dave is amazing too and think Lily Allen's new album is brilliant (not as good as her album No Shame though which was the best). Haven't heard of any of the singers you've referenced but will make sure to educate myself. Love and light 😂 x

I was hooked the second I heard her on kiss fm...i don't even listen to pop or top 40, I was just going through stations on the commute home. best day in a long time today after hearing Olivia Dean for the first time. I used to drum for jazz and r&b bands back when I was in my 20s too so this really struck a deep note with me. also gives me hope for our next few years of music. they just seem to get better and better then past few.

> Oh good grief. That type of music has always been around. Just because it wasn't popular with YOU doesn't mean it did not exist.  You folks tickle me with these narratives and these "finally" comments. It's as if it takes you to like or love a particular artist before you acknowledge that a genre exists.  It's a great song. Let it be that without the overzealous moral grandstanding. It actually takes the attention away from the artist.

> ❤ I can't get this tune outta my ear, my girl and I we quit after 12 years, wonderful years I tried my best to be the man she need but I  failed in many ways.

My advice to everyone who cares about ur love and beloved, talk and find solutions don't be selfish for your own purposes be clear with goes and no goes and the hell... Show love ❤ it's the most important thing every living being can show and give and it costs nothing

> @Sepet-1984 I’m glad you shared your view, but let me be clear: I’m not here to sugarcoat what I believe. There’s been a trend in music where swearing and twerking are seen as the norm, and I simply don’t agree with that direction. I’m celebrating a return to depth and dignity in performance, not judging every artist, but definitely choosing what aligns with my values. That’s not hate, that’s discernment.

> The first time I heard this song was two weeks ago in Thailand! I was in my hotel room sad because the guy I’ve been talking to decided to randomly ghost me! Every lyric in this song talks about my experience with that guy😢! It’s a beautiful song, somehow I found myself smiling every time I listened to it(and that was the whole night). I woke up the next day ready to tackle the rest of my vacation days🥴😅

>  @barrynolette4708  I hear your point, but I stand by what I said. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with expecting a standard of music that doesn’t rely on swearing or sexual imagery to carry it. That doesn’t mean I’m tearing anyone down, it means I’m choosing to celebrate art that uplifts without needing to shock. We can support women and still desire music with purity, substance, and intentionality.

> I like modern music. I will NOT support those who slander people who aren’t “classy”. Sex and the body are beautiful and should be treated as something to be proud and open about. 

HOWEVER, yes, sometimes just listening to an old soul in a young woman let out some just smooth music hits right where I need it, and that’s okay too. Congrats Olivia Dean on your win at the Grammys.

> It is refreshing to just see a SINGER perform as an artist without being half undressed. Let your vocals do your speaking for you. When I saw Olivia preform on the Grammys and heard her opening vocals.....I knew she was the real deal and someone who is going to mature into an even better artist. Stay grounded and true to yourself.  Congrats!!! On your first of many Grammys.

> I love the parallel to the music video for "Nice to Each Other," with all the moving parts. The camera work is exceptional, and her acting is so fun. She's great at expressing herself in a spontaneous yet elegant way. I'm obsessed with her voice! Every scene is cinematic. The production is stellar, and Olivia is so, so beautiful! Such a short and purposeful music video.

É lindo e fantástico. Pra mim ela é maravilhosa.

Bellaquita

[Verso 1: Dei V]
Me diste follow y te di followback
Me diste like y yo te di dos pa'trá'
Toma, al otro día me pusiste en los close friends
Eso es lo que tú quieres, ma
Voy pa'l DM, de espalda, de la'o o de frente
En toa' las fotito' se ve bien
Mami, te lo doy ahora y después también
Subió una story cerca, estoy que le llego a pie, еh
Ouh, ma, yo quiero que tú sea' mi loba
Tú mе tiene' a mí en la cuerda floja
Woh-oh, si nos vamo' underwater, te moja'
Yo te vo'a comer como una luz roja

[Pre-Coro: Dei V, Omar Courtz, Ambos]
Y dale, actívate (Actívate)
¿Que quién va a pagar hoy? Ma, tú olvídate (Olvídate)
Tú te viene', yo voy, dale, sígueme (Sígueme)
Con ese culo embuste de anime (Anime), ma, de anime
Dale, actívate (Actívate)
¿Que quién va a pagar hoy? Baby, olvídate
¿Tú te viene' o yo voy? Dale, sígueme
Esto es lo que estabas buscando
Mi mensaje bellaqueando

Baby, tú lo hace' como si supiera' (Como si supiera')
Hasta tú te pondría' bellaca si con mis ojo' te viera', te viera'

[Verso 2: Bad Bunny & Omar Courtz]
Ey (Ey), tú y yo nos vamo' a ver, nos vamo' a conocer
Vamo' a bailar (Vamo' a bailar), vamo' a beber (Vamo' a beber)
A bellaquear (A bellaquear), despué' a coger
Tú te va' a juquear y esto se va a joder
Vamo' a terminar mal, sí
Porque yo soy un problema
Y porque tú 'tás buena
Pero yo tengo mis nena'
Las que no suelto, pero tú 'tás suelta, sí
Pero tú 'tás suel—, pero-pero tú 'tás suelta, ey (Ey)
Tú ere' una pitcher, mami, pero yo me crié en la loma
Tú va' a soñar conmigo despué' que te la coma
Yo bajo pa' tu barrio lowkey en la Tacoma
O si no en la Lambo en una movie cabrona
Ey (Ey), chequéate el AP, nunca se va de hora
Por eso ningún culo me ajora, embuste
Estoy que te preño ahora (Bellaquita)

[Verso 3: Omar Courtz]
Le llegó bien loca como una gringa en La Perla
Baby, te habla Ousi, un placer conocerla
Ando con Bad Bo, con Dei V, tú con tus girla'
Y no sé si es la yerba, pero tú tiene'
Los ojo' chiquitito' como si fuera Don
Te pasé la lengua como sellando el blunt
Baby, tú te suelta' con el tequi y limón
Eso atrás bien grande, bebé, como una Yukon
Cierra los ojo' y piénsame
Yo estoy bebiendo y también quemé
Ella quiere un mensaje que diga: "Ven"
Yo me paso mirando ese culito en internet

[Puente: Omar Courtz]
Baby (Baby), ese culo es de bichote
Y yo siempre quise ser bichote
Vámono' pa'onde no se note
Que cuando yo te azote, ey (Azote)

[Coro: Bad Bunny & Omar Courtz]
Vamo' a ver si es verda'
Vamo' a ver si es verda', vamo' a ver si es verda', vamo' a ver si es verda'
Eh-eh
Vamo' a ver si es verda', vamo' a ver si es verda'

[Post-Coro: Omar Courtz]
Baby, tú lo hace' como si supiera'
Hasta tú te pondría' bellaca si con mis ojo' te viera', te viera' (Viera')

[Interludio: Wisin]
¡Yeah!
Bebé, a mí me dijeron que tú metes mano

Tú sabe', los ídolo' tuyos
Seguramente te estás preguntando cómo lo hacen
Tienen que apretar, ¡bum!

> For the non-Spanish speakers, here's the history lesson he included on the"slide"!

Porto Rico: The Early Years of Americanization in Puerto Rico (1898-1936)

Puerto Rico has had different names throughout its history. Indigenous communities called it Burunquen or Borikén. Upon their arrival, the Spanish renamed it the Island of San Juan Bautista. Later, it became known as the Island of Puerto Rico until it was simply called Puerto Rico.

At the beginning of the 20th century (1900s), just five years after the American invasion, its name was changed again. Puerto Rico became known as "Porto Rico" in official U.S. documents. This name change was due to the fact that Americans were unable to pronounce the word "Puerto." The new name lasted a couple of decades before it was changed back to Puerto Rico.

> Para todo los que se preguntan si es la voz de De  la rose, efectivamente asi es.... Esa voz sensual es incomparable...👿🔥

Bad bunny no es la primera vez que añade pequeños fragmentos de voces de artistas como parte de su creatividad y no sonar tan monotono, aunque no haga una colaboración como tal con los artistas.

Ejemplo  la voz de Nesi en "Yo perreo Sola"
La voz de Ñengo Flow al final de " La Zona"
La voz de Wisin al final de " Velda" 
La voz de  Miky Woodz en "Ni bien Ni Mal" 
Etc..

Al final es parte de su creatividad.

> The blue rose is a fascinating symbol, largely because it doesn't naturally occur. This fact has heavily influenced its meaning. Here's a breakdown of the blue rose's symbolism:
 * The Unattainable:
   * Because blue roses were historically difficult to create, they've come to represent things that are out of reach, impossible, or highly desired but difficult to achieve.
   * This can include dreams, hopes, and desires that seem beyond grasp.
 * Mystery and Intrigue:
   * The rare and somewhat unnatural appearance of a blue rose lends it an air of mystery and intrigue.
   * It can symbolize the unknown, the enigmatic, and the desire to explore the unseen.
 * The Impossible Dream:
   * Blue roses are often associated with the pursuit of the impossible dream, the striving for something that may seem out of reach.
 * Unique and Extraordinary:
   * Their rarity makes them a symbol of uniqueness and extraordinary beauty.
 * New Beginnings:
   * In some interpretations, especially with the advancement of genetic modification that has made blue roses more available, they can also symbolize new possibilities, and pushing past limitations.
Essentially, the blue rose captures the essence of longing for something special, something that transcends the ordinary.

> Jennie just addressed everyone in this song who ever tried to put her down or copy her. "Special edition that your AI couldn't copy", "Keep your hair and nails done like Jennie, who else got'em obsessed like Jennie", a slap for those who are always labelling others as the 'next jennie' but we know that there will never be a second Jennie. The hardships this girl went through, not everybody can be as strong and brave as her. People can copy her style and looks but they can never be THE JENNIE KIM. The impact she holds is incomparable.

> I wanna say to the people listening to the song, i know you might not believe me but it sounds very similar to the song "Rani's theme song" from the movie rocky aur rani ki prem kahani mainly the main hook. The "Jenny Jenny" part. It is incredibly similar to the lyrics in the bollywood song i mentioned which says "Rani Rani ki kore ki kori ami jani". I know there are many fans of her here and might choose not to believe me. But I'd recommend you go check it out once
Edit: the movie was released before this song

> @ananasnasdass  Yes, Jennie is super smart, she loves capybaras but the capybara is a spiritual animal, even the crocodiles let them walk on them, they take care of their own lives, who else represents a capybara other than Jennie? She made Zen and some of the songs are about trusting yourself and finding inner peace, she herself has already talked about it... although she loves the capybara at the end of the mv it also represents that she is one because she identifies with the spiritual animal.

Plus it’s the album experience not a concert, they’re in a theatre literally!! I think she’s using this to also better her performances for coachella and figure out the set list and how crowd respond to different songs.

i feel like none of the blackpink members have left kpop, since they also didn't leave BLACKPINK, they're just not limited to the kpop industry and currently just more focused on the mainstream/western pop media.

### 1. @Raun18 (2504 chars)

> 🏆 TATE MCRAE: THE 2025 RECAP & 2026 ROADMAP 🏆
2025 was officially the year Tate McRae went from "rising star" to "global pop powerhouse." Between her record-breaking album So Close to What and her first-ever arena world tour, she has dominated the industry. Here is everything you need to know:
🔥 2025 AWARD WINS & DOMINATION
Tate absolutely cleaned up at the major ceremonies in 2025, specifically in her home country and on the MTV stage.
1. The 2025 Juno Awards (The Big Winner)
Hosted by Michael Bublé, Tate was the most-awarded artist of the night, taking home 4 out of her 5 nominations:
✨ Artist of the Year
💿 Album of the Year (for THINK LATER)
🎤 Pop Album of the Year
🎶 Single of the Year (for "greedy")
2. 2025 MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs)
Tate’s contribution to the F1 movie soundtrack became the anthem of the year:
☀️ Song of the Summer ("Just Keep Watching")
🎬 Best Editing ("Just Keep Watching")
3. Other Notable Wins
APRA Music Awards: Most Performed International Work ("greedy").
Hollywood Music Video Awards: Best Choreography ("It's OK I'm OK").
🚀 BIG NOMINATIONS & MILESTONES (EARLY 2026)
The momentum isn't stopping. As of January 2026, Tate is in the running for some of the biggest honors in music:
💎 2026 Grammy Awards: Nominated for Best Dance Pop Recording for "Just Keep Watching." (Winners announced Feb 1st!)
🎬 Guild of Music Supervisors Awards: Nominated for her work on the F1 soundtrack.
📻 iHeartRadio Music Awards: Nominated for Artist of the Year, Pop Artist of the Year, and Best Fan Army.
📈 Chart History: Her album So Close to What debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 and was certified Platinum in late 2025.
👀 WHAT’S COMING NEXT IN 2026?
Tate is not slowing down. Here is the blueprint for the "TM4" era and beyond:
🌍 Miss Possessive Tour Extension: Due to overwhelming demand, Live Nation has added more arena dates for Summer 2026 across Europe and Asia. Fans in Japan and Southeast Asia—get your wallets ready!
🎹 The Fourth Album (TM4): Tate has teased that she is heading back into the studio. Rumor has it this next project will be more "introspective and experimental," leaning into R&B and trap elements while maintaining her signature high-energy choreography.
📸 Historic Covers: Tate just became the first-ever artist to grace the cover of the inaugural Rolling Stone Canada (January 2026 issue), where she discussed her "Mamba mentality" and future collaborations.
🎤 Dream Collabs i want in 2026 is with Miss Thing Charli XCX or mama Sabrina Carpenter 🪚 ❤

> alright time for a bad Music Video Sins impression:
0:05 Is this room lit all the time, even when not in use? If so, why? That seems like an unnecessary addition to your electrical bill. DING
0:26 Madame, there are no jeans on you to take off. All you're wearing is a leopard onesie. DING
0:37 I assume this question is rhethorical, because you just answered it yourself by throwing the keys onto the floor. DING
1:00 I don't know what this is yet, except possibly one of the weirdest car commercials, even weirder than that Jaguar one. DING
1:05 Having no Mrs, i.e. not being married, does not excuse cheating on your partner, Tate. DING
1:10 If by 'uh-uh', you mean exercising precise control over what is other wise a 200 miles-per-hour murder machine, I'm all for it. DING
1:12 If not, that's a moving violation. DING
1:23 It took 83 seconds only to show us the sports car of the 19th century. DING
1:35 Fortunately for you, we live in an age where turning 'so good it hurts' into simply 'really good' is one Tylenol away. DING
1:37 Before this verse, you were seen ominously staring at a horse. DING
1:42 On the corner of this stack of mattresses, the thing you did before this verse was most likely falling down. DING
1:45 Nothing says avant-garde interior design like a V10 engine block. DING
2:29 Let me remind you that at this point, we are 2 minutes and 30 seconds into a music video entitled 'Sports car', with no motor vehicles seen so far, so you  do not have authority over not wasting time here. DING
2.35 For us go ride, I need you to stop wasting time dancing in an open aquarium first. DING
2:58 Yes, I know what this is: Prelude to the Premiere of "An Car" in A Phrygian Dominant. DING

> I think we really need to address as a society how we consider this song "dirty" when clearly we all know that as a society she is talking about "sex" and specifically "sex for pleasure" and I think I think this needs to be normalized in society so that it is not considered "dirty" but a normal human experience that is essential and necessary to everybody in society to participate in a healthy way. Human sexual desire and pleasure are completely and totally biological and physiological and are not "dirty" or "inhumane". These feels are NORMAL. Especially female sexual desire and female sexual pleasure. It is not "dirty". If you want to go and have sex, please go and have some. Its not "dirty" and "irreligious". The dirty part is imposing your views on morality on others, whether you think sex and "dirty" songs like this need to go "mainstream". Only then will we not really have the need to listen to these songs anymore because sex for pleasure is NORMAL. Ofcourse anything does in excess can have really really extensive health issues and consequences. Whether you chose to listen to this song or not or whether you like her or not really does not matter. What does matter is that you choose to respect peoples' diverse array of opinions and thoughts, moral and religious believes regarding sex and advocate for a healthy view of sex and pleasure in society so that we can also live healthy and happy and liberated life. Its really really important to be respectful people!!!!!!!!!!!!! Let's make that popular in all households!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

> @woooooooo9061 No if you haven’t noticed they have been pushing out the older artists and replacing them with more modern acts. Giving them the old artist formula so they don’t have to break the bank on trying to bet on an artist with a sound that may or may not pop off. Her giving Brittney vibes is what’s making her pop using Brittney’s formula to engage her fan base that miss her music, same thing with tyla as the rhianna replacement they’ve been doing it for awhile now to the point I’m seeing them everywhere I can name them all. Doja cat and nicki Minaj, Chloe Bailey and Beyoncé, Amy winehouse and RAYE, JoJo and Tyler Luis, I meaning how many artists are they using to replace Taylor swift with atp 🤷🏾‍♂️the list can go on. Most of them flop/get sabotaged before they ever get to uproot the older artists, especially if that artist in question is still pushing in the game, but for people like Britney and Rhianna that’s easy because they walked away.

> So many Britney fans getting upset at Tate being inspired by Britney makes y‘all 50 year old gays look so insufferable. ShE‘s JuSt cOpyInG HeR. Oh fuxk off. If that’s the case Britney herself has always been a Janet Jackson copycat. Like 1 to 1. Britney didn’t invent any of this. Every pop girl did this in the 2000s bc they were all formed with the Janet Jackson formula. Britney just happened to be the most prominent white solo girl to do it. She was never even the first after Janet so I’m not sure where all the entitlement comes from. Tate probably saw a bunch of 2000s pop girl videos and went with that. It’s obvious she draws inspiration from that era. Britney is a huge part of that and she literally approves Tate. So instead of whining, cope.

> She’ll eventually be ousted from the industry. The industry was, is and will always be the ones running the show. They’re just ‘ letting’ mom think they’re running the show. Debbie Gibson, who wrote, produced, and performed her own material, had mom by her side every step of the way until the Industry showed them the door.  In a sad attempt to regain fame Gibson, at 40 years of age, no longer with mommy by her side, did theater with the promotion that Gibson appeared  ‘nude’ in one scene.  Tanked!  No one was interested in seeing a 40 year old former teen pop star naked. 
Debbie Gibson, Brooke Shields, Molly Ringworld—all had mommy on the set.  All three were done and gone by the time they were 30.

We knew the real (I hope we did) Tate back when she was singer songwriter who can dance. She made songs you could connect with and showed her talent their with choreo that highlighted dance skill. APPARENTLY, she has hit it big, sooo big, that now label/manager has taken the direction over to the cliche hollywood sex symbol who doesnt really do shit but look the part. She has plenty of talent (besides live stage imho) but its just about money now.

- Samara having long black hair w. the horse 
- The room with the tvs and the chair in the middle  where Samara was interrogated by the psychologist
- The bedroom with the mattress, wallpaper, and lamp like Samaras bedroom in the barn 
- The red outfit that kinda resembles the fire with the tree
- The WATER at the end of the video with her in the tank
- The white sheet attire Tate wears like the scene where Rachel finds Samara in the well

Tate's stunning choreography and on-screen presence wouldn't have had such a BLAZING and DARING effect if not for all the carefully placed hard cuts and transitions, which go on to also tell the story behind the song. I really commend the cinematography too, it really brings out the look and feel of the action the camera is capturing.

> @jayy-b1y9k lmao sounds like you’re the one that lost sleep over it bud. And what’s with the yelling? I’m well aware ppl can have their own opinions. But I can also tell the difference btwn someone being jealous and putting their misery onto others like that other person was doing commenting how much Tate sucks on like every other comment on this vid. I wasn’t even talking TO YOU. But u seem butthurt too answering everyone so pls find something better to do with ur free time. It’s NOT this deep 😂😂

> In the Vogue interviews it is said "You don’t realize it until the end, but Tate is watching herself in the video. In all of these different settings, you’re watching Tate in a way we’ve never experienced Tate McRae as. The big picture of all of this is that you are in control of your life, your relationships, and your fashion. Even though your fans have this idea of you, in the end you are in control. She’s a beautiful woman and I’m a fashion kid, so I wanted to transform her"
