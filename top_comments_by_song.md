> Ууу

I, I just woke up from a dream
Ай, ай джаст воук ап фром э дрим

Where you and I had to say goodbye
Уэр ю энд ай хэд ту сэй гудбай

And I don’t know what it all means
Энд ай доунт ноу уот ит ол минз

But since I survived, I realized
Бат синс ай сэрвайвд, ай риэлайзд

Wherever you go, that’s where I’ll follow
Уэрэвер ю гоу, зэтс уэр айл фоллоу

Nobody’s promised tomorrow
Нобадиз промист томорроу

So I’ma love you every night like it’s the last night
Со айма лав ю эври найт лайк итс зэ ласт найт

Like it’s the last night
Лайк итс зэ ласт найт

⸻

If the world was ending, I’d wanna be next to you
Иф зэ уорлд уоз эндин, айд уона би некст ту ю

If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
Иф зэ парти уоз оувэ энд аур тайм он ёрт уоз сру

I’d wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile
Айд уона холд ю джаст фор э уайл энд дай уиз э смайл

If the world was ending, I’d wanna be next to you
Иф зэ уорлд уоз эндин, айд уона би некст ту ю

⸻

Ooh
Ууу

Ooh, lost, lost in the words that we scream
Уу, лост, лост ин зэ уордз зэт уи скрим

I don’t even wanna do this anymore
Ай доунт ивэн уона ду зис энимор

’Cause you already know what you mean to me
Коз ю олрэди ноу уот ю мин ту ми

And our love’s the only war worth fighting for
Энд аур лавз зи онли уор уёрθ файтинг фор

⸻

Wherever you go, that’s where I’ll follow
Уэрэвер ю гоу, зэтс уэр айл фоллоу

Nobody’s promised tomorrow
Нобадиз промист томорроу

So I’ma love you every night like it’s the last night
Со айма лав ю эври найт лайк итс зэ ласт найт

> Guys sing it loud I got lyrics 

I just woke up from a dream
Where you and I had to say goodbye
And I don't know what it all means
But since I survived, I realized

Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night

If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you

Woo-ooh

Ooh, lost
Lost in the words that we scream
I don't even wanna do this anymore
'Cause you already know what you mean to me
And our love's the only war worth fighting for

Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night

If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you

Right next to you
Next to you
Right next to you
Oh-oh-oh

If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you

Ooh, ooh
I'd wanna be next to you

I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
Ooh
Oh, lost, lost in the words that we scream
I don't even wanna do this anymore
'Cause you already know what you mean to me
And our love's the only war worth fighting for
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
Right next to you
Next to you
Right next to you
Oh-oh, oh
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
Ooh
I'd wanna be next to you

> There's a kind of witchcraft they cast on you while you're working, making you reminisce about happy or funny moments. You lose track of the fact that you're up high , even though you're working at heights.

When they put you in a game for American papeles for exsmple, they sometimes start showing you the real reason behind a song.

Imagine what could happen if you're remembering funny or happy things while working at a height.

To die with a smile.

The worst part is that they then try to make you feel bad if that were to happen.

Hay una brujería que le hacen a uno mientras está trabajando estarse recordando de momentos bonitos o momentos chistosos Pero uno pierde noción de que está en una altura, sí está trabajando en alturas. 

Cuando lo meten en un juegos por papeles americanos le empiezan a mostrar a uno a veces el verdadero motivo porque hacen alguna canción. 
Imaginarse que podría pasar si uno por estar recordando cosas chistosas o bonitas mientras está trabajando en alguna altura qué podría pasar. 

Morir con una sonrisa.

Lo peor es que después tratan de hacerlo sentir mal a uno si eso llegara a suceder.

It's already such a beautiful song, but it will now, forever, and always hold a deep meaning for me. He loved Bruno Mars. He was the kindest man I have ever known, even in his final days. I love you, uncle Craig. I know you're flying high up in heaven, free of pain, heart full of love. I'll see you again one day on the other side. 🕊️

> Rumors are he's one of the only songwriters in pop who writes slowly. Most pop songs are written by/with non-artist pop writers, who with few exceptions write an enormous number of songs very quickly, of which only the best few percent ever get recorded. Because Bruno (these days) is mostly writing for his own lucrative artist projects where it's guaranteed he can place the songs he's been working on, he can afford to take a long time (it sounds like sometimes years) to keep coming back to a song and refining it; which for a style that often plays with delicate balances of nostalgia and experimentation is probably very important. But to the extent that he's unusually consistent at doing stuff other people can't pull off, that's probably a big part of why.

> This is what most artists used to do before the 2000s: disappear for two or three years minimum, live some life out of Hollywood, gain some inspiration, then come back to public eye to release a new album.

Modern day artists who know deep down inside they don’t have the talent to be remembered and valued to disappear for longer than a year, push out album after album every few months to a year and a half, hoping they can manage to push out some vocally sub-par hit with a catchy beat because now music is a highly-competitive and global market compared to how it was before the 2000s.

His music touches my soul.” And feel the same way but with Lady Gaga’s songs. My mom sadly passed due to metastatic breast cancer that came back in her bones. I was her only caretaker and she was all I had. She passed June 11th 2023 and I’m 19 now. This song came out and it hits me so close to home cause I wasn’t there when she passed. So yes I just wanted to hold her just for a while and for her to die with a smile. I feel like my mom sent me this song to tell I’ll be ok.

If Star is born was relaunched to honor Kris Kristopherson and the highwaymen this song has earned its place in history along with Ariana Grande and The Wkend collaborations.  Timeless classic waiting for the right movie  and scene. You can truly forget time and space when listening every time.

In the 2020s, that's now basically non-existent. If we were still in the early 2010s artists like Sabrina Carpenter, Olivia Rodrigo and Harry Styles would've been picked by other huge artists to do collabs in the way Katy Perry was selected for "If We Ever Meet Again" in 2009, Justin Bieber was selected to do "Live My Life" in 2011 and Carly Rae Jepsen was selected for "Good Time" right after the success of "Call Me Maybe" in 2012.

But Jesus promises eternal life for all who trust in Him, so we should go to Him. He historically lived, died on the cross for our sins (to free whomever would believe from the punishment their sin deserves), and rose again—so he truly can take us to heaven. I'm saying this because I truly care about you guys and want you to be saved. Trust in Jesus and repent. He has proven himself to be the truth, and above all else, He loves you so much.

Don't get me wrong, I found it to be an enjoyable pop song, but it didn't strike me as special or groundbreaking in any way; particularly lyrically. Half of the lyrics are tropes from pop songs of the last 40 years that have been previously written in some form or another and used countless times in other songs already. It's just a very generic "I love you so much that here's a list of things that could happen and I'd want to be with you" love song. shrug

### 1. @TwO-FiStEd-BeTtY (1694 chars)

> @Billie, 
 
So disappointed in you.  I am a professional musician (as well as other professions) and respect the trade. Not only disappointed in you, but most all entertainers and artists in general (actors, sports figures and industries of the kind. e.t.c...). I'm sorry...I love your story that you and your brother going from rags to riches. You've both have made absolutely beautiful music together. You're smart and have almost a prodigy talent. But, I take issue with any entertainment professionals who seem to not only use there job and accolades to preach on stages, especially award stages of which they were nominated and won just to preach. Maybe it shouldn't be in that particular environment but on your own time to show your beliefs whisch is your 1st amendment right. Which you have the right to do. But making comments like you and others have done on the Grammys, a show for the public to enjoy their favorite artist? Idk, just IMO, not the right time. I would have honestly respected you and others more if it wasn'tsaid. I want to be entertained and enjoy yours and others well deserved accomplishments I would not be allowed while doing my job and telling my customers my political opinions or any opinions other than my job. Most major corporations would fire me because it reflects on the company that I work for, so I respect that. Free Speech are all our rights, but not while doing our jobs. And as you and I know, what you do is a job. Actually,  a very hard one. But again and unfortunately, I will be unsubscribing. Love your music, your artwork including the documentaries. I just cannot at this point, support what you and others have said. I wish you the best! ❤

>  @shilpita100   you let it change you for the better or the worse. pain from true love heartbreak doesn’t just go away on its own. It needs to be channeled…

you have to channel the pain into progressing your “value” (looks, personality, career, friendships, etc.) so you can turn the situation around mentally from feeling heartbroken, to feeling fulfilled from all the value you added to your life that probably wouldn’t have happened without that relationship ending. to get to this point though, you need to take time to grieve over the “loss” (its actually a gain) of the person without distractions. a lot of people run from healing by distracting themselves with other people or drugs. then the unhealed pain turns them into a mediocre person with little value.

Heartbreak is what matures most people into being the functional (or not so functional) adults they are today. You can let it mature you to your benefit, or let the pain create little piles of chaos in your life that altogether, will send you down a life path far from the person you want to become; and it will feel almost impossible to come back from this once your brain has been negatively programmed from the trauma of how you let a breakup spiral your life out of control. 

pain from heartbreak is a powerful tool that only one can master through experience. those who do master it more quickly than others have a great support system cheering them on. I believe in your ability to overcome this. people are meant to exit our lives as we grow into new chapters. if you focus on your happiness outside of a partner, theres exciting, unexpected people and paths ahead of you ♥️

> I was in the same position at 14 and my parents fully believe I would have taken my own life had they not sent me to a TTI for two years. 6 years later I am 20 years old and still can't fathom what was going through my head when all of that happened. I don't really remember much of my teenage years but what I do know is my parents were there through all of it. The medication, the doctors, everything, they provided help because they CARED, and you guys did all of that for her. You wanted her to get help and that shows what a great family you are. Please do not blame yourself, it is not your fault, I will never not blame myself for the day I was in the hospital for an OD and my father was kneeling by my bedside crying and blaming himself. As kids who are struggling, we don't want to hurt out parents, and I really didn't realize back then that when I struggled, my family struggled too. I didn't realize we were all in it together because I was so clouded by these challenges. I don't know exactly why your daughter did what she did, but what I do know that after death comes peace - I remember it all too well. Your daughter is safe and sound, I can promise you that. Your daughter loved you very much and I'm sure it may have been an act of impulse as most of us at 14 did. We really don't mean to hurt you guys, we just thought it was the only way out. It isn't, but she is safe now. I know this isn't much, but I will say a prayer for your daughter, she sounds like she was a wonderful girl. Never ever blame yourself, you were a good parent, you tried your best, and so did she. Have a good night!

Can't change the weather, might not be forever
But if it's forever, it's even better

'Til the day that I die
'Til the light leaves my eyes

You would keep the compliments I throw ya
But you're so full of shit, uh

Say you wanna quit, don't be stupid

Tell me it's a bit, oh
Say you don't see it, your mind's polluted
Say you wanna quit, don't be stupid
And I don't know what I'm crying for
I don't think I could love you more
Might not be long, but baby, I
Don't wanna say goodbye
Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know ('til the day that I die)
I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone ('til the light leaves my eyes)
Can't change the weather, might not be forever ('til the day that I die)
But if it's forever, it's even better
I knew you in another life
You had that same look in your eyes
I love you, don't act so surprised

I want you to stay
Till I'm in the grave
Till I rot away, dead and buried
Till I'm in the casket you carry

If you go, I'm going too, uh
'Cause it was always you, alright
And if I'm turning blue, please, don't save me
Nothing left to lose without my baby

Birds of a feather, we should stick together
I know I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone
Can't change the weather, might not be forever
But if it's forever, it's even better

And I don't know what I'm crying for
I don't think I could love you more
It might not be long, but, baby, I

I'll love you till the day that I die
Till the day that I die
Till the light leaves my eyes
Till the day that I die

I want you to see, mmm
How you look to me, huh
You wouldn't believe if I told ya
You would keep the compliments I throw ya

But you're so full of shit, hmm
Tell me it's a bit, oh
Say you don't see it, your mind's polluted
Say you wanna quit, don't be stupid

And I don't know what I'm crying for
I don't think I could love you more
It might not be long, but, baby, I
Don't wanna say goodbye

(Birds of a feather, we should stick together) till the day that I die
(I know I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone) till the light leaves my eyes
(Can't change the weather, might not be forever) till the day that I die
But if it's forever, it's even better

I knew you in another life

> How is land stolen when there are no borders?!  If the Los Angeles Basin is returned to the Tongva Tribe, what would that mean when there are no borders! It would mean anyone can settle the land, making ownership a moot point. This is the problem with Marxists like Eilish,* they employ divisive nonsense that is easily seen to be not only absurd, but contradictory. 
===================
A Marxists prime mission in life is to follow  Karl Marx's 1843 directive to implement the "abolition of religion", and the destruction of those civilizations "whose spiritual aroma is religion"...

Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right, Karl Marx (1843)

"The struggle against religion is, therefore, indirectly the struggle against that world whose spiritual aroma is religion."

...and...

"The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is required for their real happiness. The demand to give up the illusion about its condition is the demand to give up a condition which needs illusions."

...and...

"It is, therefore, the task of history, once the other-world of truth has vanished, to establish the truth of this world."

Now you know what Marxists are referring to when they utter the phrase, "The Struggle"...

"The struggle against religion is, therefore, indirectly the struggle against that world whose spiritual aroma is religion."

> It’s okay to cry when you hear this song or when memories of her come flooding in. It’s okay to grieve as deeply as you loved her—because love and grief are intertwined. In those moments, let yourself feel her presence, her spirit, and the love she left behind.

Your daughter’s story deserves to be told, and so does your pain. Sharing her journey and the challenges she faced could help others who may be struggling. You are honoring her by remembering her, by loving her still, and by seeking answers to the tough questions.

Be gentle with yourself in this time of unimaginable sorrow. There is no right way to grieve, no timeline to follow. If you can, lean on those who care about you, whether friends, family, or support groups. You are not alone in this, and there are others who can help carry the weight of this heartbreak with you.

Your daughter will always live in your heart, as you beautifully said. Her memory, her laughter, her essence—they are all a part of you. Hold onto that love, and when you’re ready, let it guide you toward healing, one small step at a time. And if this song supports your healing let it play on.

Keeping you in thought and prayers. I hope you can find moments of peace and comfort, even amidst the pain. 💔

> I lost my 14 year old daughter on August 14th of this year and every time I hear this song it makes me cry. I miss my daughter so much. I know she is an angel now, watching over me from far away. Baby, I miss you so much. You will always live in my heart.

My sweet daughter was bullied at school by other students, which led to severe depression and anxiety. My family taking her to multiple doctors and she took medication every day.but we didn’t see anything that getting better. Plus health insurance often wouldn’t cover the necessary treatments. 
I remember the morning of 8/14, I was getting ready for work, I spoke with my daughter and said, “Honey, Mom off to work now . I hope you have a great day at home. Call me if you need anything. Love you!” She replied, “love you too.”
That evening, when I returned home around 5:00pm.I knocked on her door and asked how was her day going so far. I called her name twice, but there was no response. When I opened the door, I found that she had taken her own life. I was paralyzed with shock, screaming and crying uncontrollably. I immediately called my husband, telling him that our baby girl was gone. He rushed home and called 911. I miss her everyday. I trying to find the answer why?

Look who promote it all

> Whether a country sits on "stolen land" depends on how you define the term, but displacement is a universal theme in human history.
​Historical Reality
​Nearly every inhabited part of the Earth has been conquered, settled, or reclaimed by different groups over millennia. While the "stolen land" label is most frequently applied to settler-colonial states (like the U.S., Canada, and Australia) where Indigenous populations were systematically displaced by foreign powers, historical migrations and conquests mean most modern borders were drawn through conflict.
​Key Factors
​Settler Colonialism: Modern debates often focus on the Americas and Oceania because the displacement of Indigenous peoples is relatively recent and documented by legal treaties.
​Global Conquest: In Europe, Asia, and Africa, borders have shifted for thousands of years due to empires, tribal wars, and migrations, making it harder to identify a single "original" owner.
​International Law: Most current borders are recognized by the UN, though many groups still pursue land claims based on historical sovereignty.

I already cracked the code of this song before you so eloquently elaborated here per her interview. It absolutely describes me and my disconnect with my karmic soul mate I finally met, fell in love with when we first copulated, only to have to break up with him for good after a few go-rounds (ScorpiHOE ♏️, drunkard, deadbeat dad, recidivist criminal, passing out STDs, stole from me--you name it)
in spite of our undying love and lust for one another. I'm even listed officially as DNR (do not resuscitate) bcuz I don't wanna live bcuz his absence HAUNTS ME--as does his deceased fiancé prior to me who was also my former student! She shows me both their names/other reminders of them EVERY DAY IN EVERY WAY! In comment sections, on social media clips, TV shows, or movies I watch, on random searches about other people--you name it! 

So when I say this song resonates with me--BELIEVE IT! 😫😤🤬

> For me, it's more like this:-

1- the chair in the start instead of 4 is hanging on 2 legs states about the inner psyche of confuse and unable to decide the things.

2- the invisible force is Kindof inner thoughts which is taking back into her own past breaking the wall means she is unable to ignore as he legs are hell bent on stopping her but still she is going back. And why it is my guess is because after breaking the wall apart from the damage that has already been caused , still some damage are already there like broken glass and stuff ( describe toxicity in relation) means now she is reliving the event in the mind.

3- Then she proceed onto the start again after reliving those moments and we see her teared out laying on the floor plus the chair has fallen and it stats that the mental health is completely broken and the screen turns black means no chances of revival.

This that pink venom, this that pink venom
This that pink venom, get 'em, get 'em, get 'em
Straight to ya dome like woah, woah, woah
Straight to ya dome like ah, ah, ah
Taste that pink venom, taste that pink venom
Taste that pink venom, get 'em, get 'em, get 'em
Straight to ya dome like woah, woah, woah

[Verse 2: Lisa & Jennie]
Black paint and ammo, got bodies like Rambo
Rеst in peace, please light up a candle, this the life of a vandal
Masked up and I'm still in CELINE
Designer crimes or it wouldn't be me (Ooh)
Diamonds shinin', drive in silence, I don't mind it, I'm riding
Flying private side by side with the pilot up in the sky
And I'm wildin', stylin' on them and there's no chance
'Cause we got bodies on bodies like this a slow dance
[Pre-Chorus: Jisoo & Rosé]
자 오늘 밤이야

Look what you made us do

원한다면 provoke us
감당 못해 and you know this
이미 퍼져버린 shot that potion
네 눈앞은 핑크빛 ocean
Come and give me all the smoke
도 아니면 모 like I'm so rock and roll
Come and give me all the smoke
다 줄 세워 봐 자 stop, drop
I bring the pain like

Omg you are literally the QUEEN of our hearts and the most magical, beautiful, inspiring melody of our lives!!! 😭🎶 Every part of you — your voice, your smile, your energy — just lights up the world and makes everything feel more special ✨💛🖤. From On The Ground (where you showed us all how strong and grounded you are) to Gone (that beautiful, emotional song that gives us all the feels), and even number one girl and APT.

I honestly don’t even know how to put into words how much you mean to us because you give sooo much love and light through your music and your presence. I hope your day today is filled with as much joy, sparkles, love, laughter, and yummy treats as you can imagine 😆💖🍰, and that this whole year brings you even more happiness, inspiration, and beautiful moments that make your heart sing!!!

> For anyone confused, "Apateu" is actually a Korean drinking game, and the name comes from the English word "apartment." The chorus rhythm is the same as the chant in the game where people shout, "apateu apateu, apateu apateu," before starting. So, there’s some clever wordplay with the lyrics "meet me at the apateu (apartment)." The intro is also a reference to the "Random Game," where the loser of the last round picks the next game to play, and in this case, Rosé chose to play "Apateu." I think she was trying to incorporate that fun and wild Korean drinking culture vibe and energy into the song

Since there were some people asking about the rule:
The way it works is, the leader picks a number, and then everyone stacks their hands in a pile. The person with their hand at the bottom moves it to the top and counts up from 1, all the way to the chosen number. Whoever ends up saying that number has to drink soju as a punishment.
You can catch Bruno Mars and Rosé playing the game at 0:49! (although it's not exactly the same as the real game)

>  @Akshayaaaaaa  A lot of kpop fans, and fans of a lot of modern music these days, can be very shallow because the reasons they are fans of certain idols is really superficial, like how cute/sexy the idol is, rather than how good their music is. This is what I think makes fans of certain idols so toxic - because when their favorite idol gets any kind of legitimate criticism, they'll angrily defend them because they don't want to admit they only liked them for their looks and don't have anything genuine to praise them for. Toxic people don't want to admit that they're wrong. The more an idol's popularity doesn't match their actual musical talent, the more toxic the fans. This is why Rose's fans are generally not toxic. Because there's so much more to her to praise than just how she looks.

> The song is good, but drinking games are dangerous and alcohol is a drug. I know people don't like to hear that but it is what it is.

Therefore I would have preferred if they made a song that did not glorify reckless drinking. People are gonna say "it's not that serious bro, this is just for fun", but both Rose and Bruno have impressionable underage fans who are now 100% gonna try this game because of this song. Sure, most people know when to quit and say no but some don't. 

So imo that part is not something to be proud of. However, it's not like the glorification of alcohol is rare in pop culture so it's not surprising nor are they alone in this.


Alas, doesn't change that the song is catchy 😅

> ​ @XxsoldarkicexX  You hit the nail on the head. I see so many people comparing this song to Mantra or Rockstar or w/e but Lisas and Jennies songs may be fully english, but still have this Kpop vibe to them. Rosé simply has her own style and she executes it well and passionately. Obviously the feature of Bruno pumps up the views alot but I doubt Bruno would've collabed with her if Rosé had proposed a Kpop-sounding alternative. It just doesn't suit his style idk. Also as much as I love the songs of the other BP girls I Rosé (obviously) has the best English and that probably also plays a big part... I find Jenni's Rap to be a bit incomprehensible at times :(

She is so brave .  I respect her.  Others are just using Rosie as sample  to produce album,  collaboration with world singers .and brainstorm an idea..

> She has a better record with her song On the ground. She obviously doesn't care about charts, otherwise she would have promoted this song.  Any other idols would have done crazy promo for Collab with Bruno Mars. Good songs do well on long run with or without pre release promos. Only Debut numbers depends on pre release promotions (which kpop fans are obsessed with for some reason). 
On the ground had 40M+ views in 24 hours plus debuted number 1 on global billboard charts on debut week. 
This song will do lesser than that on global charts, but probably will do well in USA because of Bruno.

> A lot of people here are conveniently forgetting that 'APT.' is Rosé's song. She wrote it and she pitched it to Bruno as a demo. Bruno is known to be extremely selective in terms of who he collaborates with and the fact that he enthusiastically chose to partner with Rosé speaks volumes. Also, this collaborative effort initiated by Rosé also highlights what an intelligent and savvy business woman she is, and that's in addition to her phenomenal talent as an artist. Oh, by the way, Rosé owns 100% of the master recording for 'APT.', so guess who's laughing all the way to the bank ?

0:48 In this game, players stack their hands on top of each other to represent the floors of an apartment building. The leader selects a floor number and counts down to find the tagged player. The person whose hand is on that floor must drink as a penalty and then chooses the next number to keep the game going!

This is what I consider typical of the derivative, undistinguished and empty-headed music that makes it big on the charts these days.  It's insipid, having only a cute singer to recommend it--and even then, she's hardly unique and the video is cheesy and unimaginative.  No wonder so many people are going back to the classic music of the rock and pop genres of the 1960s-70s for much more creative, diverse and distinguished songs and performances.

You got me kissin' thе ground of your sanctuary
Shatter me with your touch, oh Lord, return mе to dust

> Trying just means not giving up so if you try you can’t lose and if you have nothing you have nothing to lose so just try I know there will always be bigger and harder problems but each time you solve one you get a little bit better cause the ultimate output of each problem solved isn’t that you solved the problem it’s you Pain is like the ground it will always be there sure you can take a plane to avoid it but you will always return to the ground there is no avoiding it pains the same way, like you can try to avoid it with drugs or scrolling or porn or whatever you want, but it's always gonna be there. So I think if you say pain is a bad thing, then you set yourself up to be unhappy forever, because you can never avoid it. Like pain is there. But the ground is not a bad thing. For sure. The ground is just proof that you're on Earth, and without it, you never learn how to walk. And pain, it is just proof that you're alive and And I think you need to let yourself feel the pain, because as much as we want to have these healthy, positive motivations, at least for me, it's a lot more effective to run from the pain. But just because you run from it doesn't mean it's bad. All that means is that it's something that makes you run. And here's the thing You don't need to know what you're running towards. All you need to know is what you don't want, and then you can run as fast as you can in the other direction. Because if the thing you're running from is wanting to end your own life like it's that bad, that death is a viable option, no amount of suffering or discomfort is gonna be worse than that, right? So just pick something, it doesn't even matter what, and just put the pain towards that. Because, you know, you're gonna suck in the beginning because you don't know what you're doing and you're new. But if you do something for enough time, enough times, you will become good at it. And if you're good at something, it's a hell of a lot easier to enjoy it. So that's how I see it.

I take one look at you

You're takin' me out of the ordinary
I want you layin' me down 'til we're dead and buried
I'm on the edge of your knife, stayin' drunk on your vine
The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowin' we found
Somethin' so out of the ordinary
You got me kissin' the ground of your sanctuary
Shatter me with your touch, oh Lord, return me to dust
The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowin' we found

Hopeless hallelujah
On this side of Heaven's gate
Oh, my life, how do ya
Breathe and take my breath away?
At your altar, I will pray
You're the sculptor, I'm the clay

Oh my, my

You're takin' me out of the ordinary
I want you layin' me down 'til we're dead and buried

Shatter me with your touch, oh Lord, return me to dust
The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowin' we found

Somethin' so heavenly, higher than ecstasy
Whenever you're next to me, oh my, my
World was in black and white until I saw your light
I thought you had to die to find

Somethin' so out of the ordinary
I want you laying me down 'til we're dead and buried
I'm on the edge of your knife, stayin' drunk on your vine

Are you holding your guitar? Do you have the chords yet? Can you play the song? Ear it out, just like Rick taught you. 
Don't read my chords, until you give it a try, then I'll give them to you (after listening to the song 1 time through and learning it in real time, so there its a basic interpretation, I'm a basic guy)
Intro: Em, D    (12 fret bar the top 3 strings for Em, then drop down to D major 11, 10,10.  Pick them straight and down in triplets, and to nail the timing quickly, just play the lowest note only right on the quarter note. Once you do that, you'll have it.)
Chorus: Em, walk up to G major (E, F#, G), then keep walking, (A, Bm, then back down to 'A', then back down 'F#, E'.) It's a really walking part, so just keep walking up to the next chord, then back down, then all the way back down through F# back to Em.   The song is in Em so it's always, Em, G major, A major, Bm. 
It's also really fun to, on the very first low note introduction to reach down and pluck your open low E string with the piano, and then pluck the open D string when you switch to the D chord. It messed my timing up, but if you nail it, it would be real good.
That's about all I know, as I only listened to it once.
Great song, gave me goosebumps after listening to the back story. And the girl was so pretty, the low end was so thick and rich, the singing very syncopated (try playing and singing it, if you do that, you're doing real good.), I really enjoyed it.

>  @Makeupbykimberlyp  On April 2019, I heard - Tell them I am coming soon. Later in the day I heard: There will be a great shaking. When I didn't tell a particular church about it, I got a dream where I was scared. I could hear myself saying: I'll tell them, I'll tell them, I'll tell them. Then I saw a person in the dark with well lit church windows behind him and another person dressed in white walking behind him and up some stairs.

Jesus is coming. Good time to be right with Him. On April 9, 2021, my vision went black for a quick moment, I saw in gold letters - Thus saith the Lord.  Four hours later? On April 10, in my sleep I heard - Prophet. Tell them I am coming soon. Maybe 3-5 min after that, at 1235 AM, our area had a 3.1 eq.

Rev 3 vs 3  Have in mind therefore in what manner thou hast received and heard - and observe and do penance - If then thou shalt not watch, I will come to thee as a thief - and thou shalt not know at what hour I will come to thee.

> I'm so sorry, it's a tough road ahead. But know that his love will be with you always. It's only now, 7 years after my husband passed that he feels more distant. Keep talking to him, look up "continuous bonds" that brought me much comfort and ignore Khubler Ross (she's now outdated). Look after yourself. Grief does weird things with time.  You'll think, it's been ages, and people will tell you that it's still recent. Know you are not alone. Many are walking that path of grief with you, some further along with a lighter burden, some struggling under the crushing weight of a recent loss, but all of us carrying the grief, always, and the love. Big hugs. ❤❤

> I've heard (and I don't know if there's any true to this so don't come for me!!) 
But I've heard that the reason those singers hire other actors/actresses is because in the event the relationship won't work out, their (now) ex-partner is not starring in one of their songs.
Which to me makes sense because should that song be your Number 1 hit song.. the one you're most known for.. the last thing you want is your Ex forever being the star/main character of the music video 🤷‍♂️

Sad when you think about it but also kinda logical.

I'm not a singer though so like I said, not sure if there's any truth behind it 🤣

I couldn't get myself together; I was filled with so much resentment and anger, and it still is. However, after two and a half years, I slowly began to see the light at the end of the tunnel... I have to move on for our children. At first, I couldn't imagine another woman by my side. Now I'm looking around, searching for love, a mother for my children. It's hard to find a good other these days... Hold on tight, don't give up, try to live and be happy; your husband would want that.

I love the song, but when I took the time to listen to the lyrics properly, it left me with a sadness because I'm middle aged and never found this kind of love. Only verbally abusive idiots.
I know this love isn't something we all get to experience. I always wished this kind of love would come for me, but it never did.
I'll still keep this song on repeat though. It's beautiful.
To those who have found this kind of love, cherish it. To those who haven't, I hope we get to experience it at least once in our time on earth.

> ​ @honeybeetee  No! Absolutely NOT! I won't tolerate that kind of blasphemy. Nobody is perfect except God. And yes, angels can get jealous, that's literally where sin started. Satan and a third of the angels grew jealous of God's love for us and His desire to have us rule over creation with Him, including the angels.

Furthermore, jealousy itself isn't wrong. God is perfect, but He is also JEALOUS for us. When we reject and turn from Him, He is jealous because we were made to worship Him and are rejecting our purpose to pursue false idols.

Bold and arrogant, they are not afraid to heap abuse on celestial beings; yet even angels, although they are stronger and more powerful, do not heap abuse on such beings when bringing judgment on them from the Lord. But these people blaspheme in matters they do not understand. They are like unreasoning animals, creatures of instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed, and like animals they too will perish.”

Before I surrendered to Jesus, I was doing things that would make me feel love. There was not a thing. AFTER I surrendered to Jesus, He filled me with the most amazing love.  He likes me and helps me to love myself as well. There is also a wonderful peace that He gave me. Loving yourself alone doesn't do it.

Pero queriendo volver a la última vez que a los ojos te miré
Y contarte las cosas que no te conté (te pareces a mi crush, ja, ja)
Y tirarte las fotos que no te tiré

Yo veo tu nombre y me salen suspiros
No sé si son petardos o si son tiros
Mi blanquita, perico, mi kilo

Debí darte más besos y abrazos las veces que pude

Ya se terminó
Ey, que prendan las máquinas, voy pa Santurce
Aquí todavía se da caña, chequéate a las babies
Diablo, mami, qué dulce
Hoy yo quiero beber, beber, beber
Y hablar mierda hasta que me expulsen
Toy bien loco (toy bien loco), toy bien loco (toy bien loco)
Cabrón, guía tú, que hasta caminando yo estoy que choco

> YO, IN THE WHITEST ENGLISH IN THE WORLD I MUST CONFESS, this is the difference in other music, THIS CROSSES ALL THE WAY OVER, All the way….. I don’t speak Spanish, I don’t need too either. This is perfect! I understand it, I feel it, I’ve been nothing but loved from the country and people of PR as long as I can remember. All my friends in central pa growing up came from pr in the years before I met em…. I love the people,,all the family, all the love…. This song represents all of em I’ve known, laughed, and loved every single second of knowing em or getting to know em! I love PR. I love fact that I don’t need to speak Spanish to know this song is about memories made and who we make em with….. this song has a superpowrer, it breaks down a big big big wall and opens a world to everyone, be ready to dance after you eat and drink… keep an open mind and then open your ears up to it enough to enjoy what everyone else is experiencing and you’ll get to be apart of it AND ITS BEAUTIFUL…. Congrats TO PEURTO RICO you’ve produced the chosen one to make music into move than it’s genre… this hasn’t been done since bob marley, and he.spoke English. Bad bunny said hold my beer and just crushed it…. All praises. Thanks for the open invitation PR for people to enjoy their life in your company…. We are all lucky….. all the respect in the world from the white kid in central PA -717 feels the love

> Eu tive um grande amor há 4 anos. Ela se chamava Nathaly Alves Dufner, e até hoje penso muito nela. Ainda sonho que um dia possamos nos reencontrar. Depois dela vieram outros relacionamentos, mas ela foi a mulher que eu mais amei na minha vida.
Infelizmente, a mãe dela pediu para que terminássemos, pois pensou que eu poderia bater na filha dela. Talvez pudéssemos ter continuado ao menos como amigos, mas na época eu recusei, porque era imaturo. Hoje, eu daria tudo para conversar com ela mais uma vez, para ter mais um abraço, mais um beijo e mais fotos. Eu deveria ter feito tudo isso quando tive a chance.
Eu sei que ela não vai voltar e talvez nem se lembre mais de mim, mas eu sempre me lembrarei dela.
Eu tinha 16 anos quando a conheci, na escola, na primeira série — se não me engano. Mesmo que já tenham se passado alguns anos, eu nunca vou esquecer o quanto eu a amei. E parte de mim ainda ama.
Se algum dia você ver essa mensagem, saiba que Enzo Ferreira Bahamondes — ou, como seus familiares costumavam me chamar, “Gesequinho” — nunca te esqueceu e nunca vai esquecer, porque você foi a mulher que eu mais amei e caso queira falar comigo algum dia meu Instagram ainda é gesequinho, espero que no futuro possamos nós encontrar novamente.

Cuando fui para verla ya era muy tarde no me dio tiempo antes de yo llegar murio y viva no la llegue a ver nunca mas.  Despues me regrese porq senti abandono y aca es donde tengo trabajo. Ahora de vez en cuando aun me doy en el pecho q debi haber estado ahi. Siempre recuerdo q la ultima vez q la vi le dije abuela yo vuelvo pero no fue asi. Era la unica abuela que me quedaba y ya no la tengo. Mi familia aprendio a vivir sin mi pero yo aun no supero vivir sin ellos ya no se si vale la pena seguir aca y deseo regresar y nada aqui afuera aun estoy estrañando el coqui 💔 Gracias Bad Bunny en verdad si debi tirarle mas fotos de cuando la tube, debi darle mas besos y abrazos las veces q pude 😞😭

>  @Rennzz-r2r  Trata acerca de la nostalgia de lo que se hizo, pero también de lo que no fue posible realizar, por alguna u otra razón. Es una suerte de arrepentimiento doloroso por no capturar momentos que en su tiempo prefirió no fotografiarlos por vivir sencillamente el presente, pero que luego se ve en la fatídica necesidad de querer visualizarlos no solo en los recuerdos, sino también en algo material, en una foto. Bad centra su atención en una persona en especial, pero se pudiera aplicar este pensamiento a absolutamente todo, porque al fin de cuentas todo deja una huella en nuestra vida. Me atrevo a decir que es también una linda forma de agradecer a la vida y a las personas por el pasado, porque al querer tener fotografías es porque considera que, aunque ese tiempo y esas personas no van a volver, para él siguen siendo valiosos. 🫱🏽‍🫲🏼❤️‍🩹

> Que mucho me he gozado esta canción, pero que mucho me ha hecho llorar también. Soy mexicana, hace 9 años me vine a vivir a los Estados Unidos y hace 7 años que no voy para México, y como extraño, cuantas ganas de volver. Perder a mi tía hace 4 meses, que más que una tía, fue una madre para mí, y no haber podido ir a mi país y por lo menos darle un último adiós, me sigue doliendo en el alma. Yo creí que estar lejos de casa realmente ya no me afectaba, hasta que aconteció el fallecimiento de mi tía, y me di cuenta que, la herida de alguna forma sigue ahí, y que aún sigue doliendo.
¡Gracias, Benito! Tremendo tema, tremendo álbum. Gracias por recordarnos el vivir y gozar el aquí y el ahora, y a disfrutar de los que amamos mientras los tenemos presentes. 🫶🏻

> "DtMF" is a nostalgic reflection on the importance of treasuring moments with loved ones. Bad Bunny expresses regret for not capturing more photographs during meaningful experiences, emphasizing how those memories become valuable over time. The song invites us to value the present and the people around us, reminding us of the transience of life and the relevance of preserving memories.
Bad Bunny has sparked speculation about his relationship with his ex-girlfriend, Gabriela Berlingeri. Some fans interpret the lyrics as reflecting nostalgia and regret for not having captured more moments during his relationship with her. Lines like "I should have taken more photos, kissed more, hugged more" suggest a desire to have treasured more memories together.

> This shit has got me crying, I want to thank the person who made this.
When my grandfather first died, I was fairly young. At the time, I was so surprised that I didn't even cry at his funeral. Listening to this song made me think of him. It was the first time I truly felt what he meant to me. I cried listening to this, after I realized that he was the only man in my life who ever wanted me to be better than him. He was the only man who kept me around because he loved me, not because I had something to give him. I never paid him back what I owed him through what he did for my life. That was the only time I never gave someone back what I owed.

First I was really surprised he was announced to headline the biggest award show in the country the Super Bowl on the news and just now  he won a Grammy for album of the year for “ I should’ve taken more photos “ so I decided to give him a chance and wow after reading the lyrics last night I had the best time what a beautiful album so introspective and personal.

How can you look at me and pretend
どうしてそうな風に僕を見るの？

I'm someone you've never met?
まるで会ったことないやつみたいに


[Verse 2]
It was last December
去年の12月のことだった

You were layin' on my chest
君は僕の胸の中で寝ていた

I still remember
まだ覚えているんだ

I was scared to take a breath
息をするのが怖くて

Didn't want you to movе your head
君に頭を動かして欲しくなかったんだ


[Chorus]
How can we go back to being friеnds
どうして友達に戻れると思ってるの？

When we just shared a bed? (Yeah)
一緒に過ごしたっていうのに

How can you look at me and pretend
どうしてそんな風に僕を見ることができるの？

I'm someone you've never met?
初めて会ったやつみたいに振る舞ってさ


[Bridge]
The devil in your eyes
君の瞳の中の悪魔が

Won't deny 【dɪnάɪ 】the lies you've sold
君が売り込んだ嘘を否定しようとしない

I'm holding on too tight
僕は離さないようにしがみついる

While you let go
なのに君は離れようとしている

This is casual
僕たちってただの体の関係なの？

[Chorus]
How can we go back to being friends
なんでそうやって友達に戻ろうと思ってるの？

When we just shared a bed? (Yeah)
ベッドを共有したばかりなのに

How can you look at me and pretend
どうしてそうやって僕を見るの？

I'm someone you've never met?
まるで他人みたいにさ

How can we go back to being friends
なんで友達になるの？

When we just shared a bed? (Yeah)
さっきまで一緒にいたよね

How can you look at me and pretend
どうしてそんな目で僕を見るの？

I'm someone you've never met?
まるで一度も会ったことないやつみたいに

> this song really hits me because,  he and me were really good friends, until the last november he kissed me, and then things happened, and I was really confused and nervous because i kinda get into him romantically, he told me that he was in love with me and he didn't wanted me to know it that way, he apologized to me, said that he don't want to make it something formal in that way.
I was happy 'cause i was in love with him but never said something, after all that he said to me we started to hang out and I went to his house and we played PS and watched tv, we were really fine, but all was in secret, only my bff knew, he really was in love i think, i felt it, i knew, but after school finished he started to talk less to me, time passes and i went to his house again, he wasn't the same, i told him how i feel about that and he apologized, then we just stopped talking, i was really, I AM, really bad, it just make me so sad, cause he was an important person a really close person, there was no explanation of anything, i wanted to talk to him but it always ended up on apologizes, till this day he don't text me anymore, idk what happened it just make me sad, i don't know what im gonna do when school starts again because we are "friends" again now, like we both just ignored everything that happened, he stopped being the way he was

sorry i needed to say it to someone, please never do that, never fall in love with your friend

> I feel like it, my ex did me so dirty, she cheated out if nowhere too, we almost had a child, we went through so much together we even knew each other when we were 15, lived right across each other and would sneak out together at night, we'd literally plan it on the bus on the way home, her parents almost never let her have a phone so we had to make a time when to sneak out beforehand lol, but i moved away for 3 years and came back, we lived together in our own apartment, her dad tried to kill me, like we did go through a lot even as kids, anyways yeah she cheated out of nowhere, told me she loved me and said so many nice things right before, then came back to confess and say she didnt even want another chance she was just done with me lol, said i shouldve seen it coming and this and that, I couldnt believe it, a whole year of me thinking I know her well but instead she shows me a side of her I never knew she had nor wanted to see, she had no guilt nor remorse, she only had selfish desires in mind and i could see that clearly in that moment, it was like a whole flash of thinking who the hell is this woman, all those memories and experiences with her for nothing, were they all fake? When did they become fake yk, still so many unanswered questions I have left

> Because it’s roughly the same chord progression and tempo of indie-ish breakthrough pop from 2010. MGMT kinda, but think more like Gotye (“now you’re just somebody that I used to know”). It’s intentionally ‘nostalgic’, it’s music that’s tailored to fit a fashion cycle trend of 2010s “indie” soft-rock/pop/punkish dance pop imitations. I wish I didn’t know to be so cynical but it’s just how the industry works. I wouldn’t be remotely surprised if the label used WGSN focus groups etc. It’s a good song, but in 2009-2013ish we had the real deal, and it was much more adventurous, varied…a wave of music that was accessibly poppy but idiosyncratic, kind of melancholy and semi cerebral, guitar/voices/synth driven. You got Vampire Weekend, Santigold, MGMT, Silversun Pickups, and IMO the greatest band still at it, Animal Collective (tho AC is much more left-field and avant). And yeah innumerable more

I went to college when that stuff was big, there’s so much great stuff that you might faintly even recognize but not know how to place it, assuming you’re the younger age bracket. I’ll post a playlist I made a while back of that era/set of sounds if you’re interested in something like this with a lil more wild at heart

> Whenever I hear this song, it feels like my childhood memories rewind themselves—especially the moment I first met my first love, maybe around 2010. It sounds crazy, I know, because I was only eight years old then, a third grader in elementary school. Maybe it seems too early for a child to have a ‘first love,’ but it was real.

Now, at 23, even though I have a partner I love dearly, sometimes those memories still come back, quietly, unexpectedly. Sometimes my current partner asks me if there’s still a place in my heart for that first love—and the truth is, maybe there is, just a small corner.

What I regret is that we never had the chance to speak again. We met during school exams—he was in fourth grade, and I was in third. He was so kind, smart, handsome, and his smile… his smile was as bright as the sky after the rain. I mean it—he had the sun in his smile.

Sadly, after the exams and after he graduated, I never got the chance to know him better. I was too shy, always believing it was better to keep my feelings hidden. But if alternate universes exist, I hope there’s one where I had the courage to speak to him. And if reincarnation is real, I hope I get to meet him again, even if only as a friend.

> Just fumbled the bag after having a crush on this dude from my class for a year. Its the second to last day of schoolIve always thought this guy would never like me because his previous gfs were gorgeous 10/10s and he was lowkey popular and Im very mid and not super popular but still kinda known lol. So Its the second to last day of school and my crush's friend runs over and says that my crush like me. I think its just a prank bc me and my crush r both hella short, but then I see how my crush and his friend act around me and they are acting like he likes me. So later that day Im having my friends sign my yearbook and he comes over and asks if he can sign my yearbook and he signs his name and draws a heart next to it and all his friends start cheering. After that I didn't even ask his number, snapchat or email lol. I thought this bc at that point I wasnt rlly sure that I liked him but today I came home from the last day of school and fumbled with the perfect moment with the crush Ive had for a year and with the moment I imagined 1 million  times this year. Im going to be single forever 😭😭😭😭😭 love this song btw

> a tradução sendo a mais linda de todas: 

Toque meu corpo com ternura
Porque o sentimento me deixa fraco
Tirando as cobertas
Eu vejo o teto enquanto você olha para mim
Como podemos voltar a ser amigos
Quando a gente dividia a cama?
Como você pode olhar para mim e fingir que
Sou alguém que você nunca conheceu?
Foi em dezembro passado
Você estava deitada no meu peito
Eu ainda me lembro
Eu estava com medo de respirar
Não queria que você movesse a cabeça
Como podemos voltar a ser amigos
Quando nós dividíamos uma cama? (Sim)
Como você pode olhar para mim e fingir que
Sou alguém que você nunca conheceu?
O diabo em seus olhos
Não negará as mentiras que você vendeu
Estou abraçando forte demais
Enquanto você segue em frente, isso é casual
Como podemos voltar a ser amigos
Quando nós dividíamos uma cama? (Sim)
Como você pode olhar para mim e fingir que

> Because the song has elements of "Somebody Else" (The 1975) in the first melodic line in the voice, a similar guitar riff to Adele`s "Water under the bridge", a Production style similar to DreamPop / Shoegaze bands like Slowdive or Cocteau Twins (in their "Heaven or Las Vegas" era) or even The Cure in their early noughties. And, this song comes after the "revival" of this genre in the last ten years with bands like The 1975, the return of Slowdive, Cigarettes after Sex, Circa Waves... On top of that, the genre is caracterized by musical elements like heavy use of Reverb and eerie distorsion, long notes in certain instruments like Pads or strings giving an ethereal feeling to the production and the use of melancholic or despair-driven lyrics sing with sort of a "tiresome" stylistic  vibe to the vocals to create a character of helplessness... But wait! You were making a rhetorical question, right? Hahaha

> And during exam season, we sat next to each other. He was a cheerful and extroverted person, always finishing the tests quickly, and in between, he would tell me stories about his daily life. One sentence he said has stayed with me for years he told me that even though I was quiet, he knew that whenever he talked, I always listened and responded in my own way. He also said I was a kind person, someone who gave him space to share everything on his mind.

Sadly, I was foolish. I never responded to any of his words and chose to stay silent. I know it's too late to say anything now. Because the one time we crossed paths again during my college break we passed each other on the street by chance. We looked at one another, but I don’t think he recognized me.

And I guess that’s fair. There's no way he’d remember someone like me someone who never gave anything back in return for his warmth.

> This comment stings bc I'm a heteroromantic ace and can only have romantic relationships. I dated my ex for two years (before I was dumped eventually). 

During this time, she had s€x with her ex almost every fortnight (starting the fourth month of our relationship), and I kept absorbing that cπ@p like a fool. She even had the gall to say, "I love you romantically, but s€xually, I'm attached to my ex." I didn't feel the weight of it (probably bc I despise s€x) but it hurts like hell seven years later, realising how brutally she was gaslighting me. 

Yep it was an LDR and I definitely couldn't give her what she craved anyway, but boi she knew well how to make use of the guilt I felt. 

As much as she's to be blamed, I feel it was my fault being this gullible as well.

you need to watch what you say around everybody around you I get that you're young and you have newly acquired fame but don't risk losing it all in an effort to look silly to your fans. you can still make jokes that people won't use against you. and stop responding to people trying to cancel you. don't give them more attention and power. You're a public figure you gotta be careful with the landscape of today's culture, people are more touchy about topics that aren't even that big of a deal. I'm saying this because I want what's best for you and I want to see you succeed. Listen please before it gets worse. Think before you say or do something. Please.

> I thought the same thing ... 😂😅 Every time I'm watching MTV Classic on cable and it comes on as an ad, I could have sworn it was a song from my adult youth years (early 2010s). I think it kinda sounds like and reminds me of Sweater Weather + Pumped up Kicks & that's probably why. Like somebody else said, a lot of today's youth has nostalgia when making music. They love to incorporate sounds from prior decades and I completely understand why and appreciate it, as an old-school lover ! Bruno Mars has done this a lot and he's from my generation. This "Sombr" singer is a handsome young guy with a nice sound and voice. 🎶

The feeling of how a song could relate to a person, hell even other groups of people, and it hurts to see that she’ll never look at you the way she used too. The way she used to make you feel comfortable, the way she made you feel safe, the warmth of her hugs and the way she used to laugh, it’s all gone, but this song reminds me of the times I loved her. Even though I might cry about it, I’ll also feel good about it. Thank you for making a song that has changed my perspective on what my life was during those times.

He treated me like I was dog shit  on the bottom of his shoe after 6 years. Just like that, we were over. He flipped his feelings off like a light switch.....and I  still wonder how he was capable of that. And how he could sleep at night. This song reminds me of that time in my life.

Oh-oh-oh, 
I'm done hidin',

Oh, our time, no fears, no lies
That's who we're born to be
You know we're gonna be,

We're gonna be, gonna be
Born to be, born to be glowin'
밝게 빛나는 우린

歌詞
柯雨霏 : 
I was a ghost, I was alone
어두워진 앞길 속에 (ha-ah-ah)
馮熙燮 : 
Given the throne, 
I didn't know how to believe
柯雨霏/馮熙燮 : 
I was the queen that I'm meant to be
布子殷 : 
I lived two lives, 
tried to play both sides

Called a problem child '
cause I got too wild

> That seat of his looks like the pews in the church in Arkansas that I found...it was absolutely breathtaking...a beautiful church made of glass...I had never seen anything like it before... It was in the middle of nature and stood tall and strong...the glass structure was supported by steel beams and being surrounded by nature in the midst of a clear glass structure gave you a sense of full blown clarity...it wasn't colored glass which is beautiful but can change the way things are viewed... Color distorts the outside world...like rose colored glasses...whereas glass walls like a window offer nothing but crystal clear clarity...a clean view of what really is... The site of just the picture of the church took my breath away...it makes me wonder now if it was a real place... But to be honest my heart resonated with it the moment I saw it...and I used to talk about the significance of lush green grass and fresh plants and green trees...so to place your vessel within this beautiful glass structure meant to honor God and worship Jesus amidst the green foliage I couldn't fathom anything better...it was a suggestion of transparency and life....one of the most significant traits to have and look for... It's like taking a vow of celibacy or spending several years wearing very little if any makeup to cover your flaws...letting the entire world see who you really are...from the depths of your soul...no hiding places...no lies...it wasn't for PR...it wasn't fake...it was respect in God's honor for saving ME...for restoring my body...and preserving what God had already gifted me...in the process I took what God had given me and tried to multiply his good work in to a great many... And what I found was so very many amazing things and sadly a few tragedies...tragedies that could have been avoided... The mourning period has been just as great as gods miracles...nearly overshadowing all of the good works my intentions were initially put into place for... And the shame...the shame that individuals cast upon someone who really just wanted the life God had intended all along...that's the thing about being human...all flesh is human and humans make mistakes...but a mistake is far different than a purposeful evil act...than continued jealousy...than ridiculous greed and envy... Then sloth, theft, and outright blatant lies and defamation... And the real irony was prior to the real ugly tragedies I tried to wholeheartedly lead people to church...to show them God's grace...the light of the Lord...and all that he had to offer us as a people as long as we abide...

Dear Kendrick Lamar,

It is with deep respect and admiration that I present to you a curated selection of twenty tracks from your remarkable discography. This collection, titled Constellation Lamar, is organized chronologically to highlight the evolution of your artistry and the impact you have made on hip hop culture.

The playlist is divided into five categories: – Main Singles – Slept-On Singles – Main Bangers – Slept-On Bangers – Hidden Gems

Each track was chosen to reflect not only your lyrical brilliance and musical innovation, but also the way your work resonates with social consciousness, storytelling, and timeless energy. From early milestones such as Rigamortus and Swimming Pools (Drank) to powerful anthems like Alright and DNA., this constellation of songs demonstrates the breadth of your journey and the galaxies you have created within hip hop

This project is not just a playlist—it is a narrative, a map of your artistic universe. It is meant to honor your legacy while offering listeners a structured path through the different dimensions of your music.

With respect and gratitude for your contribution to the culture,

Sincerely, Lyric Atlas

> It doesn't take a rocket scientist or a conspiracy analyzer to figure out what's going on here when the average person in America see's this video is a regular hip hop video but what I see in this video when Lamar an SZA are looking at each other in the beginning of the video are actually 2 demons looking at one another because of their awkwardness at seeing each other leads me to believe that one of them if not both are no longer living on this earth. When a handler is over a celebrity human body sometimes they will ki** off the human body an replace it with a fallen angel because all of our technology is fallen angel software. That's why for example EMINEM looks the way he does.  An to further prove it he wrote a song WHO IS THE REAL SLIM SHADY!!!  Slim shady or Eminem they all have a side alter ego name just like Beyonce hers is SASHA FIERCE. If a celebrity is humanl*  kil*ed off on earth their soul will go to HEL*  Because they signed their soul in bl*d for fame an riches. Once they sign their soul away and cannot be reprogrammed for the 5th or so time and even sum lose their soul at signing. Just look at Ariana an BriTTYSpears. Ariana said she got reprogrammed at sum well center. We can look at BriTTYSpears an say she's having a mental BREakdown but is she? Absolutely not!!!  She is showing signs of reprogramming gone wrong either she is cloned or POSSESSed. They show you her crisis fold out on TV for a reason as I speak. Either way a soul celebrity or not can leave their earthly body and a fallen angel can take possession of. So while jamming to ur favorite rap or song that celebrity could be burning in heL right now. An for all those who claims Michael JACksoN was not a pedo he ABSOLUTELY was!!! He wore a jacket with the word PED* in the lettering word. And ppl worshipp** him an still do. The freeMAsons rituals include shammiNG someone in public or a society. They shamed MICHAELJackson because the freemasonS  know your deepest darkest secrets an they knew MICHAELJacksons secret an shameD him for it an it was of him being a pedophiLE. 
Do your own research they put it all out there thru signs an symbols for us to see it's part of their ritual. God bless

> I know this probably won't make a difference but awareness is the only tool we have left in this world of deception...I believe all of these Hollywood celebrities are just like Diddy..it's just that when they want you gone they expose your stuff to the public..but I believe everyone is like that in that rhelm... bruh..Dr Dre who is responsible for making Kendrick Lamar blow up has a crazy history of beating up women..even in public at a club ...aaand I find it weird that Kendrick is out here supporting and being friends with people who abuse women... because this year he was with Playboi Carti and supporting him...and then he wants to be a hypocrite and pretend to care about women's rights..mxm fuck Kendrick..fuck Drake, Fuck Playboi Carti and anyone who is in support of Women abusers and who had abused women themselves...I do not want to listen to hip hop anymore ngl..or music in general, without the artist there is no art, so "separating the art is bull shit" ..I'd rather play a game of chess.

> The part where their both sitting on blue separate couches an their divide (not touching each other) refers to  them both having BLUEBlood. ReptiliAns have BLUEBlood so this leads me to believe their both FALLen AngelS  at this point. Lamar came out in 2003 his rap when he first started is no where to where it is now. In fact he's not the same person same with enimeM he looks drastically way different. Just like they did MICHAeljaCkson. They can blame it on anything these days an ppl will buy into it because that's what they do there is no coincidence and that's what they want u to believe in. Most ppl are so brainwashed an programmed they can't see the LIE in front of them. Not forgetting he sits between the two couches an say "If this WORLD was mine" that saying alone refers to the DEVil saying if he ruled the World as long as their is good in humanity SatAn doesn't stand a chance at owning this worLd. This earth belongs to our father in heaven

>  @lessgo_27 it’s deeper than just the song. To the music industry and the people that decide the Grammys this whole project really meant something more than a song on a chart. 

I’ll be honest I never even used to be a SZA fan because I just never took the time to really pay attention and thought she was a kinda shallow cash-grab type artist that would be gone after a song or two. But over the last 6 months or so I started watching more and listening more thoroughly. I realized she def has more depth and a unique style. There was some songs I loved and didn’t even realize it was her too. I always knew Kendrick was different and his background really makes him stand out. He’s an absolute genius in the music world and deserves to be recognized. So the two of them together in the multiple projects they’ve put out are actually pretty incredible if you really go beyond the surface ❤ I am really happy for them both on the awards they’ve won.

> .....  As biased as Grammy's can be, at the end of the day, it is still NOT A POPULARITY AWARD...  It's like the Oscars, the biggest box office movies aren't necessarily getting Oscar's.  To make comparisons by view count alone means a lack of understanding of how the major award shows work.  Not the Billboard or Inkigayo or MAMA type awards...

That aside, I expected Golden had decent chance to win something, but not the major categories, as the competitions were stiff.  But even so, between Golden vs APT in the same categories, I would rank Golden a high chance than APT.  Higher than, doesn't mean high chance.  Just higher between the 2.  That's my feeling at least, and in the end, neither won the major categories.  Also, as popular as APT was, I felt Golden and its movie had greater impact in culture, from adults to kinds, in 2025.

> @mrs.choosingmyhealth I keep crying too. I'm 59 and Luther is the epitome of good music and childhood.  I cried when he passed away because I never got to see him. I sometimes watch his concerts or play his music for a day and cry. This video is how you pay tribute for the ones who paved a way for you to be able to create and Kendrick knew when he made this song that the world would react & those who don't know about Luther & Cheryl Lynn will now be able to tap into our world through the video. This whole video made me cry especially at the end when  it played at tge booth and then he turned it up and you hear it so clearly.  I literally keep listening since Friday.

Also, we were best friends since 16 years old. I mean true best friends…no feelings or anything. That’s been another saving grace because when we get into a disagreement…i be like “damn, i miss my homie…lol
I’m so sorry to hear that sis. I truly hope that it’s salvageable and that you BOTH can work through it because it’s the journey of trials and challenges and overcoming them that ultimately makes your relationship solid as well. God bless and keep praying 🙏🏾

> What I really appreciate about Kendrick is just how much effort is put into everything he works on and goes above and beyond with quality. Everything from the videos, album rollouts, shows and most importantly the albums themselves. I don't ever get the feeling that Kendrick just shows up to a video shoot to hype the new single or pumps out albums to get his monthly streams up. Everything is done with such intention and artistic vision, from himself or many of the talented people he chooses to work with.  There are very few artists within music that this applies to.

> If This World Were Mine, originally sung by the great duo Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell in 1967, I was seven years old when I first heard the song. My cousin use to play it allll the time because she was in love with her first love. 😄

Then Luther V. and Cheryl Lynn covered the song in 1982 when I was 22, and I fell in love with their version. 😁

Now here it is 2025, I’m 65 years young 😊 and can honestly say I like this Luther song by Kendrick and Sza also. 

Love how Kendrick honored Luther by sampling Luther’s verse at the end. That’s an affirmation of Love. ❤️

I was a baby when Marvin and Tammi sang it, but I remember Luther and Cheryl Lynn GET’N IT ❤️ and I wouldn’t have believed that someone, especially a rapper, could make it better! I’m not disrespectful, just honest. Long live Kendrick Lamar, king of OUR music. He’s reached a Tupac Michael Jackson Marvin Gaye legendary status. Son is the ONE! 🔥 if anyone in 2025 deserves an eternal song, it’s Kendrick Lamar! 💪🏾💯❤️🔥❤️

Margin that these great creators packed their next 10
JFK is one that’s also 
   Talked about bankrolling into the Martin Luther establishment
Maybe not Martin Luther directly because I believe he JFK definitely believed he could make a presence of safety presence of this is the will of the American people
    This is the way of life
  If I only asked not what my country could do, I would just ask for something similar to the will of the country

> Why did this whole video feel like a quiet call to return to the kind of love we don’t talk about enough anymore? The kind that didn’t need grand gestures, just presence—just energy. It felt like a soft reminder of what romance used to be… not performative, not loud, but intentional. Like someone brushing your hand on purpose, asking how you’ve been and really meaning it. It’s giving vintage seduction. That slow, teasing kind of intimacy where someone shows they’re into you through the smallest, most deliberate actions. I am here for it 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾

> [Verse 1]
I could go and read your mind
Think about your dumb face all the time
Living in your glass house, I'm outside, uh
Looking into big blue eyes
Did it just to hurt me, make me cry
Smiling through it all, yeah, that's my life

[Pre-Chorus]
You're an idiot, now I'm sure
Now I'm positive, I should go and warn her

[Chorus]
Ooh, bet you're thinking, "She's so cool"
Kicking back on your couch, making eyes from across the room
Wait, I think I've been there too, ooh

[Verse 2]
What'd she do to get you off? (Uh-huh)
Taking down her hair like, oh my God
Taking off your shirt, I did that once
Or twice, uh
No, I know, I know I'll fuck off (Uh-huh)
But I think I like her, she's so fun
Wait, I think I hate her, I'm not that evolved


[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry she's missing it, sad, sad boy
Not my business, but I had to warn ya

Ooh, bet you're thinking, "She's so cool"
Kicking back on your couch, making eyes from across the room
Wait, I think I've been there too, ooh
Ooh, you've got me thinking, "She's so cool"
But I know what I know and you're just another dude
Ooh, that's so true, ooh

[Bridge]
Made it out alive, but I think I lost it
Said that I was fine, said it from my coffin
Remember how I died when you started walking?
That's my life, that's my life
I'll put up a fight, taking out my earrings
Don't you know the vibe? Don't you know the feeling?
You should spend the night, catch me on your ceiling
That's your prize, that's your prize
Well

[Chorus]
Mm, bet you're thinking, "She's so cool"
Kicking back on your couch, making eyes from across the room
Wait, I think I've been there too, ooh

You should spend the night, catch me on your ceiling
That's your prize, that's your prize

Well, mm, bet you're thinking: She's so cool
Kicking back on your couch, making eyes from across the room
Wait, I think I've been there too, ooh
Ooh, you've got me thinking: She's so cool
But I know what I know and you're just another dude
Ooh, that's so true, ooh, ooh, oh

> I could go and read your mind
Think about your dumb face all the time
Living in your glass house, I'm outside, uh
Looking into big blue eyes
Did it just to hurt me, make me cry
Smiling through it all, yeah, that's my life
You're an idiot, now I'm sure
Now I'm positive, I should go and warn her
Ooh, bet you're thinking, "She's so cool"
Kicking back on your couch, making eyes from across the room
Wait, I think I've been there too
What'd she do to get you off? (Uh-huh)
Taking down her hair like, oh, my God
Taking off your shirt, I did that once
Or twice, uh
No, I know, I know I'll fuck off (uh-huh)
But I think I like her, she's so fun
Wait, I think I hate her, I'm not that evolved
I'm sorry she's missing it, sad, sad boy
Not my business, but I had to warn ya
Ooh, bet you're thinking, "She's so cool"
Kicking back on your couch, making eyes from across the room
Wait, I think I've been there too
Ooh, you've got me thinking, "She's so cool"
But I know what I know and you're just another dude
Ooh, that's so true
Made it out alive, but I think I lost it
Said that I was fine, said it from the coffin
Remember how I died when you started walking?
That's my life, that's my life
I'll put up a fight, taking out my earrings
Don't you know the vibe? Don't you know the feeling?
You should spend the night, catch me on your ceiling

> This song has a special meaning for me. It accompanied me when I found out my boyfriend was cheating on me. There are days when I try to stay alive even though I always cry, even though I don't get enough sleep, pretend that I'm fine in front of my friends, and I was also rushed to the hospital. That woman is cool because she took my man so easily even though we have been in a relationship for a long time. Also she is one of those who comes from vietnam. Maybe now they're laughing and joking like what we used to do and share a moments. If that woman knew that now my man is calling me delusional after what we built, a liar, also his saying that he was never involved. There are so many things that make me confused and afraid about my worth and whether I deserve to love. I feel like I'm almost dead but the woman he cheated on is getting happier. I still wait for him and love him, but what I get is like that. That's not fair to me. Because he and I haven't even broken up yet but my man seems to have forgotten everything. I don't hate that woman's country but after this I have less respect for her country. I even thought about whether I could ask the woman to experience something more difficult than me. Honestly it really hurts

Ikaw ang payapang hinahanap-hanap ko

Kumakabog na naman ang dibdib
Sa pagkabahala na dala ng daigdig
Sa dami ng nangyayari, sa’n ba ‘ko lalapit?
Kung ‘di sa’yo lang ako kakapit

[Chorus]
Kapag magulo na ang mundo
Ikaw ang payapang hinahanap-hanap ko
Tumakbo ka rin patungo sa’kin
Kapag bumibigat na ang iyong dibdib
Ika’y sasalubungin
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Nais kong sumibol kasama ka
At sulyapin natin ang ating hinaharap
Ikaw lang, ikaw ang aking pahinga
Sa’yo aking gising, hanggang sa pagtulog
Sa’yo ang pag-ikot ng aking mundo

[Chorus]
Kapag magulo na ang mundo
Ikaw ang payapang hinahanap-hanap ko (Hanap ko, hanap ko)
Tumakbo ka rin patungo sa’kin
Kapag bumibigat na ang iyong dibdib
Laman ka ng bawat panalangin
Ikaw ang pahinga sa bawat sandali
Patungo sa’yo ang aking tinig
At iisa lang ang sinasabi ng pintig
Ika’y sasalubungin

[Interlude]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Kapag magulo na ang mundo
Ikaw ang payapang hinahanap-hanap ko
Tumakbo ka rin patungo sa’kin
Kapag bumibigat na ang iyong dibdib

Tila ako’y hagkan mo na

> I am just a teenager but this is what I think. There’s something about “That’s So True” that feels like someone cracked open my chest and turned my feelings into lyrics. It’s messy, it’s honest, and it doesn’t pretend to be graceful.

That line — “I think I like her, she’s so fun… wait, I think I hate her, I’m not that evolved” — hit me like a confession I’ve never said out loud. It’s that raw jealousy mixed with admiration, and it hurts because it’s so real.

And then the part that completely wrecked me: “Made it out alive, but I think I lost it / Said that I was fine, said it from my coffin.”
God. That feeling of surviving something, but not really living after it. Of pretending you're okay while still grieving the version of yourself that loved someone so deeply.

This song isn’t about healing. It’s about sitting in the pain. About admitting you’re bitter, sad, confused, jealous — and still kind of in love with what’s gone.

Gracie didn’t just write a song — she wrote a mirror. And I saw myself in every word.

I already drive, and then I would pick her up at her house like a gentleman because I'm a gentleman and she's a fan. Still, about Gracie Abrams, he even told me that he went to her concert in the United States in Texas in Dallas and that he loves this song, which is one of her biggest hits called That's So True, and well, always I hear it and I remember it a lot because she is one of my best friends, so thank you for bringing me this music, it is thanks to you, you practically taught it to me.

> [Verse 1]
Things fall apart
And time breaks your heart
I wasn't there, but I know
She was your girl
You showed her the world
But fell out of love and you both let go
 
事は崩れ落ちて行く
時間はあなたの心を打ち砕く
見た訳じゃないけど、私は知ってるよ
彼女はあなたの女だった
あなたは彼女に世界を見せてあげた
結局冷めちゃって、どっちも手放しちゃったみたい
 
[Pre-Chorus]
She was cryin' on my shoulder
All I could do was hold her
Only made us closer until July
Now I know that you love me
You don't need to remind me
I should put it all behind me, shouldn't I
 
彼女は私の肩で泣いていたよ
私には抱きしめることしかできなかった
7月まで距離感が縮まったっていうだけなんだけど
あなたが私を愛しているっていうのは分かってる
今更確認しなくていいわ
もう全部忘れるべきだよね？
 
[Chorus]
But I see her in the back of my mind all the time
Like a fever, like I'm burning alive, like a sign
Did I cross the line?
(Mm) Hmm
 
ふとした時に彼女が脳裏に現れるの
熱を感じて、火あぶりされるみたいに　前兆のように
一線を超えちゃったかな？
 
[Verse 2]
Well, good things don't last
And life moves so fast
I'd never ask who was better
'Cause she couldn't be
More different from me
Happy and free in leather
 
良いことは長く続かない
人生はとても早く進んでいく
どっちがよかったかなんて聞かないわ
だって彼女は
私とは違う人間だと思うから
レザーを羽織って幸せを感じる
 
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that you love me
You don't need to remind me
Wanna put it all behind me, but baby
 
あなたが私を愛しているっていうのは分かってる
今更確認しなくていいわ
もう全部忘れたいよ　でもね
 
[Chorus]
I see her in the back of my mind all the time
Feels like a fever, like I'm burning alive, like a sign
Did I cross the line?
 
ふとした時に彼女が脳裏に現れるの
熱を感じて、火あぶりされるみたいに　前兆のように

[Bridge]
You say no one knows you so well (Oh)
But every time you touch me, I just wonder how she felt
Valentine's Day, cryin' in the hotel
I know you didn't mean to hurt me, so I kept it to myself
 
あなたは誰とも深い関係になったことはないって言う
でもあなた触るたびに、彼女がどう思っているのかが気になってしまうの
バレンタインの日にホテルで泣いてた
傷つけるつもりはないんだって知ってるから、全部秘密にしておくわ
 
[Chorus]
And I wonder
Do you see her in the back of your mind in my eyes?
 
気になるんだけど
あなたも彼女を思い出すことはある？
 
[Outro]

And life moves so fast (Life moves so fast)
I'd never ask who was better
'Cause she couldn't be
More different from me
Happy and free in leather

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that you love me (You love me)
You don't need to remind me (Remind me)
Put it all behind me
But, baby

[Chorus]
I see her in the back of my mind (Back of my mind)
All the time (All the time)
Feels like a fever (Like a fever)
Like I'm burnin' alive (Burnin' alive) by her side
Did I cross the line? (Cross the line), oh

[Post-Chorus]
You say no one knows you so well
But every time you touch me, I just wonder I should feel
Valentines Day cryin' in the hotel
I know you didn't mean to hurt me, so I kept it to myself

Outro]
And I wonder
Do you see her in the back of your mind?
In my eyes
You say no one knows you so well
But every time you touch me, I just wonder I should feel
Valentines Day cryin' in the hotel
I know you didn't mean to hurt me, so I kept it to myself

> btw i just want to say she deserved the grammy and if your so mad that she got it then why are you listening to this song. like go get a dam life already and stop wasting it on hating on people. honestly it’s just an opinion and if you don’t like she won then cry yourself a river build a dam bridge and get over it already. she literally deserves this so much and is such a talented singer. so please stop hating it’s literally so pointless. like why come all the way to this song just to say it’s stupid. nobody cares about what you’re saying like omllll it’s a song. a good one too. now if you’re gonna hate on this song just realize how immature you look and sound. okay? and if you wanna hate on me for standing up for her then go ahead you’re just wasting your time. love you billie you truly deserved the grammy.❤🥰

> 🤗Hello. I'm sharing the gospel in various places  God created us in His image so that we might know Him and glorify Him. However, we have all sinned and fallen short of God's glory, The Bible says For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. And so in Gods great love, God sent His Son, Jesus Christ, who lived a sinless life, died on the cross for our sins, and rose again from the dead. Everyone who repents of their sins and believes in Jesus as their Savior and Lord will be forgiven, reconciled to God, and receive the free gift of eternal life. Have a wonderful day remember that Eternal life is Gods Gift Not a Reward that you work for but his Gift That we don't Deserve😊

> When this song came out, I couldn’t relate to it. I liked the way it sounded and how somber it was, but I couldn’t relate to the lyrics. Fast forward to the present and I relate to every single word. I broke up with her and I didn’t process what I lost and how much I missed her until now. I’ve never felt so broken and I don’t think I could ever find someone who’d love me as much as she did. I wish I could just go back in time and stay together, but I’m stuck rewatching memories and looking at old photos. I’m happy that she’s found someone else who can make her happy, share memories, and possibly grow old together. I just wish it was me. - Mop

> For ppl that want to know what this songs abt: Billie’s  friend got with a guy, and  broke up. Billie was there for her when she was most vulnerable. Then in July she got with him and their friendship broke apart and that’s why she says “ but I see her in the back of my mind all the time” and “ did I cross the line” showing that she regretted it. And the name of the song is because that friend owns a company named wildflower.


I’m glad she’s admitting that she did it and she was wrong for it. No hate on Billie and this is a great song.          I’ve been playing wildflower way too much😭😭😭

It’s that 'fever' of seeing someone else’s reflection in the eyes of the person you love. It’s a reminder that love doesn't exist in a vacuum—we carry the ghosts of who we used to be and who we used to love into every new beginning."😢

## 🎵 Sailor Song
**Artists:** Gigi Perez

### 1. @ripfence111 (7282 chars)

> William Afton and Henry Emily opened a restaurant around the early 70s, named Fredbear's Family Diner, which quickly evolved into a chain of restaurants known as "Freddy Fazbear's Pizza," started in 1983, under the company of Fazbear Entertainment, Inc. At some point, both of them left the company, with an unknown individual taking over as CEO.

William was secretly a serial killer, using mascot costumes to lure, abduct, and murder kids. His motives aren't known, though widely speculated to be him trying to achieve immortality through researching the paranormal, haunted metal (known as remnant), which he created through the murders.

His first target was Charlotte Emily, the daughter of Henry. She became the Marionette, a ghost who took care of and helped awaken the other lost souls.

In 1983, William's younger son also died in an incident, at the fault of his eldest — Michael. The younger son (name unknown, BV for short) 's fate is still unknown, though often speculated to be connected to either Golden Freddy (an enigmatic spirit taking the form of a yellow bear) or helping Charlie with saving other souls. "I will put you back together" was the last thing said to BV by a debatable party, most commonly believed to be either William, Charlie, or Golden Freddy.

In 1985, William killed 2 kids, and 3 others were later connected to that incident (The Missing Children Incident, or MCI). He was arrested but released due to a lack of evidence. 4 of these kids were Gabriel, Susie, Little Jeremy, and Fritz, going on to haunt Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy, respectively, with Susie implied to have been the first to die. The 5th is commonly believed to be named Cassidy, becoming Golden Freddy, though some think it's someone else.

In 1987, William pretended to be a security guard at a new Pizzeria and killed 5 more kids (DCI for short), who went on to be the Toy animatronics. This caused the unimportant Bite of '87.

In 1993, Mike worked a shift at the haunted original Freddy's. Later that year, the location was closed, and the company went bankrupt. He later had some sort of nightmares about it and his brother's death, likely paranormal in nature.

At some point, William went to that original Freddy's to destroy the 4 haunted robots, but ghosts manifested, and fearing for his life, he put on the costume he used to kill them. It was actually a part costume part robot hybrid, though, and due to the leaking roof, the machine snapped on him, killing him. He went on to haunt it and/or his corpse inside.

While Freddy's existed, a Sister Location called "Circus Baby's Pizza World" opened. It was a front for William to kill more kids, with the robots there made to kidnap them. It backfired when his daughter sneaked in to see Baby, and it killed her. She then haunted it. William, distraught, locked her and the other robots from there in an underground warehouse where they were rented out for parties. The other robots also got haunted somehow, likely with melted down remnant from some other kids, most likely MCI. Years later, William sent Mike there to find Elizabeth. Thinking he was William, she tricked him, and the Funtime Robots combined into one amalgam of wires, killed Mike, and used his corpse as a skin suit to escape. He quickly rotted, and they had to escape to the sewers. He repossessed his corpse thanks to remnant, though.

Around 30 years after his death (presumably 2023, though that may be debunked now), William was found by Phone Dude, who stole him and put him into his cheap horror attraction based on the Freddy's urban legends, not knowing William was inside the robot. After a few nights, the building burned down, and William escaped. There's also a good ending in that game where Charlie released the other spirits, but its canonicity is "complicated" according to Scott (FNaF creator).

Mike also had a security logbook at some point, where two ghosts, BV and presumably Cassidy (given it's not him), talked about something.

Finally, after like 50 years, Henry re-emerged and made a fake pizzeria, where he called the Funtime robots, now separated from Elizabeth, herself, and William. He also made a robot that captured Charlie. After a bunch of managers failed to collect all 4 robots, Mike came and succeeded. Henry burned them all and himself, with high temperatures now revealed to work on ghosts, apparently. Fazbear Entertainment, Inc. was supposedly closed for good.

But one ghost, very highly implied to be Golden Freddy, though argued as a random never-before-seen 6th MCI kid by some, wasn't ready to let William go, so he kept him from being released and tortured him in super nightmares.

There's a book series called Fazbear Frights which has debatable canonicity too that'd take place after this, but if canon it's basically just filler that nullifies the Vengeful Spirit nightmares thing.

After all this, Fazbear Entertainment was revived as Fazbear Entertainment, LLC. They kidnapped a guy and gaslighted him into living in a secluded fake house they made for him, where he made FNAF games, in the FNaF universe, as to make it seem like it was all just fake stories.

A VR game was later made, that was a remake of these, but some suspecious circuit boards were sent to be scanned into it, creating a paranormal, digital entity known as Glitchtrap. It appears as a man in Spring Bonnie (William's suit), acts exactly like William, knows stuff only William knows and even claims to be back, with William's catchphrase of sorts being "I always come back". After a bit of shenanigans, it manages to possess a beta tester and makes her his minion. We call her Vanny.

Vanessa, most likely Vanny, then got a desk job at Fazbear Entertainment. Fazbear Funtime Service, a program where animatronics were mass produced and sent for parties, etc. got hijacked by Glitchtrap who made them hostile. He made Vanessa infiltrate the service as a fake FazEnt representative, supposedly fix his infection, but actually just cut off anyone's access to the system other than him, and send a data packet with him to the current Pizzeria — Freddy Fazbear's Mega Pizzaplex.

In the current book series, most likely canon, there's this AI called Mimic1, which copies stuff. Many think that's actually what Glitchtrap is, just AI copying William. It's an ongoing debate. An Endoskeleton with it installed was sent to the last simulated Freddy's Henry built to burn, where it got out of control, started killing people and in the ongoing story is hunting down a group of teens. As the Pizzaplex was built on top of the simulated Freddy's, the Mimic got control over it too, but was quickly taken down. There's also this boy Gregory who ended up possessed by Glitchtrap and hacking the Pizzaplex for reasons unknown.

Now in Security Breach (possibly 2035), Gregory, out of Glitchtrap's control, had to escape being trapped in the Pizzaplex, as all the robots controlled by Glitchtrap and Vanny wanted to kill him. With the help of Glamrock Freddy, most likely haunted by someone, though it's unknown who, Greg ended up finding a newly built Springtrap in the simulated Freddy's and somehow defeating it. There's also a giant abomination of wires that resambles the Funtime amalgam down there, it took this William away.

> I loved her for 8 years. She was my love, my best friend, my family and everything. At first she saw me just as a friend. I told her about my real feelings two times. One in 2020 and one in 2024. She rejected me two times. In early times we stayed as friends, she told me I was just thinking that I loved her because I was going on bad times but my love for her never changed.  After I told her I really loved her, not as a friend but as a real one, we didn't talk for a while. Then she texted me that she regreted her choice, that she talked with multiple people after we stopped talking and she never felt the same with them as she felt with me. My love for her never changed so I said it's okay. We dated. Oh, god knows how much I loved her how much I yearned for her even though we never met in real. She lived far away from me and it was impossible for us to meet until we're both real adults. Almost three month ago we broke up because I said I needed some time for myself since I was going on rough times. It was alright at first, she told me it's okay and she'll wait but after just a day she blocked me on everywhere. I was so goddamn broken. A week ago I realized she unblocked me again and I couldn't help but ask why. Why she couldn't wait for a few days when I waited for her for 8 goddamn years. The excuse she gave me was stupid, almost nothing. Still I said okay. I tried everything I can for years and now I have no energy to try. But god knows how I still love her, how I'd still go back to her even though she hurted me so bad again and again. I know she probably won't see this, I just wanted to share my story because I always dream about her whenever I listen to this song. No matter what I hope someday she'll be happy. She's the love of my life and she'll always be.

I saw her in the rightest way
Looking like Anne Hathaway
Laughing while she hit her pen
And coughed, and coughed
And then, she came up to my knees
Begging, baby, would you please?
Do the things you said you'd do to me, to me
Oh, won't you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor?
And when you get a taste, can you tell me what's my flavor?
I don't believe in God, but I believe that you're my savior
My mom says that she's worried, but I'm covered in his favor
And when we're getting dirty, I forget all that is wrong
I sleep so I can see you 'cause I hate to wait so long
I sleep so I can see you and I hate to wait so long
She took my fingers to her mouth
The kind of thing that makes you proud
That nothing else had ever
Worked out, worked out
And maybe I tried other things
But nothing can capture the sting
Of the venom, she's gonna spit out right now
Oh, won't you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor?
When you get a taste, can you tell me what's my flavor?
I don't believe in God, but I believe that you're my savior
I know that you've been worried, but the truth is in my favor
And when we're getting dirty, I forget all that is wrong
I sleep so I can see you 'cause I hate to wait so long
I sleep so I can see you and I hate to wait so long
And we can run away to the walls inside your house
I can be the cat, baby, you can be the mouse
And we can laugh off things that we know nothing about
We can go forever until you wanna sit it out

And when we're getting dirty, I forget all that is wrong
I sleep so I can see you, 'cause I hate to wait so long
I sleep so I can see you, and I hate to wait so long
And we can run away to the walls inside your house
I can be the cat, baby, you can be the mouse
And we can laugh off things that we know nothing about
We can go forever, until you wanna sit it out

> I saw her in the rightest way
Looking like Anne Hathaway
Laughing while she hit her pen and coughed, and coughed
And then she came up to my knees
Begging, "Baby, would you please
Do the things you said you'd do to me, to me?"
Oh, won't you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor?
And when you get a taste, can you tell me what's my flavor?
I don't believe in God, but I believe that you're my savior
My mom says that she's worried, but I'm covered in His favor
And when we're getting dirty, I forget all that is wrong
I sleep so I can see you, 'cause I hate to wait so long
I sleep so I can see you, and I hate to wait so long
She took my fingers to her mouth
The kind of thing that makes you proud
That nothing else had ever worked out, worked out
And maybe I tried other things
But nothing can capture the sting
Of the venom she's gonna spit out right now
Oh, won't you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor?
And when you get a taste, can you tell me what's my flavor?

> I'm so deeply sorry for your loss. Losing a baby, even before birth, is an incredibly painful experience that no one should have to endure. The hopes and dreams you had for your little one are a significant part of your life, and it's natural to feel a profound sense of grief and sorrow. Although words can hardly provide the comfort you need right now, please know that my heart goes out to you. It's okay to feel whatever you're feeling and to take the time you need to process this loss. Your baby was already a cherished part of your life, and your pain is a testament to the love you had for them. 

Grieving is a personal journey, and there's no right or wrong way to navigate through it. This loss is profound, and it's important to allow yourself the space to mourn and remember the baby who was already so loved. Take the time to cherish the memories and dreams you had for your little one, and know that it's okay to feel a wide range of emotions. The bond you formed, even before birth, is real and significant, and your grief is a reflection of that deep connection.

As you navigate through this difficult time, be gentle with yourself and allow yourself to grieve in whatever way feels right for you. This is a time for self-compassion and understanding, as you come to terms with such a profound loss. My thoughts are with you during this incredibly difficult time, and I hope you find moments of peace and comfort in the midst of your sorrow.

> "i could be hated by everyone if it meant being loved by you"
- I'm sorry I forgot the poem 😭🎀



"I love you" I tell her.
And I mean it.
"I love you too" She says.

At least that's what I think she said.

It was hard to hear her over the sound of the train bolting towards us.
-The train poem



"I'm sorry that you never got to post us.."
"I'm sorry that we never got to hold hands in public.."

"Hey hey don't apologize."

"No stop please just let me say this.."
"I love you. And I will scream it off the tallest tower."
"I will tell every person on the street. I love you."
"You have shown me love, the brightness, happiness.."

"Why are you saying all of this.."

"I will find you and love you in every universe."
"But.."

"But what.?"

"I can't love you in this one and I am so sorry.."

My world stopped.
As she stared at me, I saw regret..sadness..anger.
She didn't say anything.
I didn't either.

She turned around.
"I love you"
I couldn't even speak
But oh, how I wish I could've.

A few days later.
She died.
Suicide.
I sat on her grave once she was buried.

"I miss you, and I am so sorry I didn't say it back."
Tears were streaming. Into the soiled dirt.
And maybe she felt it.
That I loved her.

I took my phone out.
I took a selfie of us.
And at last, I could finally post us.

"I love you too my love. Forever."

The next day..where I cried..flowers bloomed..
And knew that was her saying..
"I know.."

> Hey guys, I js wanted to tell you all about the good news of Jesus. Truth is, we are all sinners. The Bible says that all have fallen short of the glory of God, (Romans 3:23) because of Adam and Eve’s (the first ppl on earth) disobedience to God. Since then, we have had a sinful nature. The penalty for sin is death. Eternal death. And God has wrath towards sin. So, God sent his son (Jesus) on earth to die for our sins. To take the penalty for our sin on our behalf. So that in Christ we shall be saved! He took the punishment for our sin so we wouldn’t have to, and so that the separation between God and man would be removed! He did this bc he loves us and his love surpasses all understanding. Jesus wants us to follow him and be his sheep. (Not actually become a sheep lol) And he also saved me from anxiety and depression. He can save you from so much more:) here is a verse on how you can receive Jesus into your heart, and begin your walk with God:

 “If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.”
‭‭Romans‬ ‭10‬:‭9‬ ‭NIV‬‬

> Dear Ms Perez, or do you prefer Gigi? I am an OG butch dike from Jersey. I was fortunate to find a community, and then another one, and another. It was a heady time, music was the soundtrack of gay life. Women’s music , ally music, dance music, protest music,  and then some breakthroughs. You know who they are. My only point is this: thank you Gigi Perez. I sometimes feel that all we fought for back in the day—depressed gen x narcissism?—- was for nothing. That we have become a country of massively overproduced automatons and there is no way out of this nightmare. But then I first heard this song, and then the rest of your music, and I felt hope. You are a completely unique incarnation of the many traditions that preceded you. But there is always a choice of which traditions you choose. In addition to your talent, you have also chosen well. May your success grow. Thanks again.

> ​@Yes-x4w he is omnipotent but we don't know why he allows suffering as there isn't a answer in the bible but he has a plan for them and we just can't comprehend his works even tho he could fix it in a instant and remember he sent his only son his only son to die for us so we could be forgiven and enter the kingdom of heaven and he sent himself because in the bible it says in romans 6:23 "the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord" which means that dying is the only way to defeat sin as no sin can enter heaven but he died to remove that law and change it so we can be forgiven and also the bible isn't unreliable it is a different source of knowledge it is different from science or different from law books or stuff but it's own genre not fixed to one or anything is fixed to one but their own genre

Thank you for the memories but thank you for the hurt. I love ur family I wish all of you a happy life. It's time to move on with mine.  Time to slowly get everything back since you took it all so fast. I wonder if you ever even hurt after discarding me. It's ok regardless if you care I forgive you for almost killing me. Took me 2 years. Still get tiny flashes but it's time to go get back what I lost. Maybe in another life...lol. Goodbye to the one who helped me find me. I never found forgiveness. I still carry the guilt and grief though. It hurts. It weighs a lot. Be safe for me, find happiness. Tell nauni about me ❤

> Please read this comment. I miss you so much. I used to float, now I just fall down
I used to know but I'm not sure now
What I was made for
What was I made for?
Takin' a drive, I was an ideal
Looked so alive, turns out I'm not real
Just something you paid for
What was I made for?
'Cause I, I
I don't know how to feel
But I wanna try
I don't know how to feel
But someday, I might
Someday, I might
When did it end? All the enjoyment
I'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend
It's not what he's made for
What was I made for?
'Cause I, 'cause I
I don't know how to feel
But I wanna try
I don't know how to feel
But someday I might
Someday I might
Think I forgot how to be happy
Something I'm not, but something I can be
Something I wait for
Something I'm made for
Something I'm made for

> This song will always remind me of a close friend I met online, someone from the capital city. For about a month, we talked every day. She was going through some really tough times, and after long days we would stay up chatting. I remember listening to her pour out everything—the stress, the pressure, the pain she carried. One day, she sent me a song called “Sailor Song.” From that moment, I fell in love with it. The lyrics, the melody, every beat of it carries her memory with me.

Then, out of nowhere, she deleted all of her social media. I had no way to reach her. It hurt losing someone I was so used to being there for, even if it was just by listening. I still hope she’s okay… and maybe, just maybe, she’ll see this one day. ❤️

Edit: Hi to the person that told me to stop bc she disrespected god! Look, she didn’t disrespect him. She clearly said that she doesn’t think he is real. So yeah, first of all at least get it right. Second of all, you can respect other religions too, like atheism. Thank you!
Edit 2: Okay so guys I think I started a whole argument about religion even with not saying anything about religion in the first place soooooo sorry guys TY FOR 219 LIKES

> "I sleep so I can see you." This phrase hits differently for me when I listen to the song. It reminds me of my aunt, the one who raised me to be the person I am today. She taught me to be brave and strong in life, as well as to be kind to others and generous by giving small coins to beggars in the streets, even when we didn't have much. She passed away in August 2023 from tuberculosis. I don't see her physically now, but in my dreams while I sleep, I see her. That phrase 'I sleep so I can see you' is so meaningful to me, and I am emotional now. She was my world. I love you, Auntie, and I miss you so much.Thank u miss Gigi for this wonderful song this is so meaningful for us.

He has previously thrown my rabbit away from house because of his son only and now my cat. He was just a poor little baby. Idk what am I supposed to do. I can only cry. I feel like a lost something so precious that I can never get that void filled. I'm not just using over-exaggerating words. That's just how I feel. I feel shattered. I want to go and find him. But they left him 13 km away and fyi I'm a girl 16yo who hasn't even explored her hometown completely. Idk what should I do.

But it's alright, I'll wait patiently till that day comes and you let me in. I'll become strong enough to take care of us and I'll rise against all the odds; I'll see to it that nothing ever hurts you again. I'll be your partner and your friend, I'll be your home till the end.

Se siente feo no tenerte cerquita
La nueva mama bien, pero no es tu boquita
Mi diabla, mi ángel, mi loquita
Mi diabla, mi ángel, mi loquita, ey
Esto suena cabrón
Vamos a hacerlo otra vez
Como anoche, como anoche
Aprieta, chamaquito, aprieta
¡Ahí, ahí, ahí, vamo allá!
No, no te puedo olvidar
No, no te puedo borrar
Tú me enseñaste a querer
Me enseñaste a bailar
Ay, yo con cualquiera me puedo acostar
Pero no con cualquiera quiero despertar
Solo con usted, con usted
Yo bailo con usted, nada más con usted
Un beso donde estés, donde estés, bebé (no, no te puedo olvidar)
No, no te puedo borrar
Tú me enseñaste a querer
Me enseñaste a bailar
Y yo he tenido muchas novias
Pero como tú ninguna
Ya no tengo mi sol, me paso en la luna
Si te pienso, me tiro de una, eh-eh
Mi diabla, mi ángel, mi loquita
Mi diabla, mi ángel, mi loquita, eh-eh

> Pensaba que contigo iba a envejecer
En otra vida, en otro mundo podrá ser
En esta solo queda irme un día
Y solamente verte en el atardecer
Si me ven solo y triste, no me hablen
Si me ven solo y triste, soy culpable
La vida es una fiesta que un día termina
Y fuiste tú mi baile inolvidable
Y fuiste tú mi baile inolvidable
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh

Uno debe amar lo más que pueda

>  @jfender8023  Yo detesto la etiqueta y solamente me identifico como puertorriqueño, luego como antillano y, si acaso, como caribeño. Puede que en Puerto Rico sí haya gente originaria de provincias romanas. En el siglo XIX llegaron a ser 16% de nuestro país personas con origenes en Córcega. Puerto Rico tiene herencias muy diversas no circunscritas a la peninsula ibérica. Ahora bien, incluso a través de nuestra herencia española también somos herederos del sistema de derecho hispano-romano y de genes de antiguas provincias romanas, si bien ello se enmarca dentro de una realidad genética multirracial. Sin mencionar que en América Latina, sin incluímos a Brasil, o la América Hispana sino, existen millones de criollos blancos. Entonces, sí que se podría decir que somos latinos. No sé si al ser español, y noto una voz española en tu redacción, piensas o reduces lo de ser latino a un asunto racial, en cuyo caso solamente los españoles, portugueses, italianos, y si acaso franceses (aunque los francos son muy germánicos y solo el sur de Francia parece algo ¨latino¨), pero lo cierto es que independientemente del asunto genético europeos, ampliamente presente esos genes en Latino América, tanto en criollos como en mestizos y mulatos, hablamos un idioma derivado del latín. Que eso no constituya una cultura, una etnia, o una raza, como algunos parecen malinterpretar- es decir no existe la identidad latina- no quiere decir que no seamos latino americanos en virtud del idioma y sí, herencia genética, y cultural también.

> A ver,Bad Bunny canta horrible,obvio el reggueaton no es para todo mundo. Su música no son instrumentos,sus letras son sumamente vulgares y tener miles de seguidores no es sinónimo de talento,éxito si. En este último disco se lució con su música,con esa orquesta,con las letras,aunque de repente estás oyendo una buena canción y sale con sus frases corrientes 😂 Aún con todo eso,es enorme en donde pone a los latinos,hispanos o como quieran llamarnos a todos los que hablamos español en este Continente,nos ha llevado por todo el mundo. Por siglos nos han tratado como personas de segunda clase,segunda mano,nunca se nos ha dado crédito por los logros que toda nuestra gente logra a todos niveles,nos minimizan,nos tachan de absolutamente todo lo malo que pueda existir en la tierra. Tenemos una cultura riquísima,todos y cada uno de nuestros Países son hermosos,la música inigualable,nuestras comidas,somos corazón,apreciamos las cosas sencillas y reales,somos algarabía,celebramos la vida a pesar de todo lo feo que nos pasa,nos levantamos del maldito suelo,somos resilientes,damos la mano e igual nos reímos de nuestras desgracias y hoy él nos representa a todos. Hoy vamos a disfrutar al Benito y el escucharlo cantando  en nuestro hermoso español...Lo que no me cabe en la cabeza es como hay mucha gente estadounidense que no sabe que Puerto Rico es parte de USA,he leído cada cosa en las redes,hay demasiada ignorancia.

>  @Edwardskte  Lo dudo. La inemnsa mayoría de las orquestas eran puertorriqueñas-. Los puertorriqueños somos bien alegres y tenemos apertura a distintas manifestaciones de lo musical. Ustedes los que so ajenos a nuestra cultura consumen nuestra cultura, pero no nos entienden en realidad. En Puerto Rico uno puede escuchar lo mismo Pink Floyd que Tego que Frankie Ruiz en el mismo día tranquilamente y luego meterle a Bad Bunny. Eso te hace más rico musicalmente hablando. No entendemos la música desde esos prejuicios clasistas y, dependiendo de la época, racista. Dice César Miguel Rondón que en esos países ajenos a la cultura Antillana, en su caso Venezuela, que la Salsa inicialmente fue rechazada por ser o asociarse con negro y mulatos, la pobreza y la marginalidad. La gente prefería los Beatles. Esto nunca pasó en Puerto Rico, donde mi padre escuchaba The Bee Gees o Air Supply y a la misma vez a Eddie Palmieri. Claro, eventualmente se tuvieron que abrir a la Salsa y del mismo modo con el Reggaetón, pero ningún salser en Puerto percibe o piensa mal del Reggaetón. Esa no es nuestra mentalidad ni apreciación como cultura.

> Te lo diré de esta forma: Soy de los que, cuando escuchó por primera vez a Bad Bunny, decía: "¡Pero qué voz tan fea tiene este tipo! ¡Lo peor que se cree que canta!"; luego comencé a poner atención cuando sacó "Callaita" y "Dakiti" que dije "Bueno, este tipo no tiene la mejor voz, pero algo trae que me atrapa"; ahora con "Un Verano sin ti" me convencí de que el problema no es su voz, el problema es que yo no sabía apreciar su arte. Puedo disfrutar un Da Vinci, un Dalí, un Rembrandt, un Matisse, pero eso no quita que también pueda disfrutar un Pollock, un Miró, algo más abstracto. A la gente le podría parecer que Pollock solo hacía rayones sin sentido, pero ciertamente, su obra, no convencional, es capaz de conectar para quien está abierto a su tipo de arte. Lo mismo creo que podría aplicarse con Bad Bunny: OK, su arte es diferente, no convencional, pero es capaz de conectar, por eso decidí olvidarme de mis prejuicios y aceptar su arte como es y disfrutarlo, así, sin más.

Como Bailarin y instructor de baile te puedo decir que la cancion tiene tremendo ritmo y soneo para bailarla y gozarla, y tambien quiero agregar que la Salsa fusióna pasión, ritmo, coneccion y cultura es una actividad social que permite y te ayuda a conocer a otras personas, a aprender a expresarte y relacionarte de otro modo y te ayudará a soltarte. Nos permite tomar conciencia de nuestro propio cuerpo, aprender una nueva forma de comunicarnos y expresarnos, por lo que nos permite reforzar y ganar confianza en nosotros mismos. El bailar salsa puede tener muchos beneficios para la salud, como mejorar la flexibilidad, la coordinación, reducir el estrés y controlar el peso. Gracias! Gracias! Gracias! por haber echo esta cancion de Salsa! y ahora a Bailar!!!

> I am now playing Bad Bunny DAILY on principle; I just endured WEEKS of hearing crying from dudes who’ve spent the last 8yrs calling everyone who’s different than them “snowflakes” - only for them to absolutely MELT DOWN, when an AMERICAN from AMERICAN soil happens to perform in the 3rd most utilized language on EARTH. 

So everytime I play this, it’s for those “tough guys” that like to call everyone a snowflake. It’s to watch their ignorant asses MELT DOWN. 😂 they say “I can’t understand” GUESS WHAT tough guy?? I’m a native, lifelong Spanish speaker & I have to listen VERY carefully to understand the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish 😂😂

Nuestra Plena comparte, según los musicólogos cubanos Argeliers León y María Teresa Linares, tiene elementos primigenios con el Son (VÉASE Los Elementos Primigenios del Son), y la Salsa es cómo nosotros cogimos el formato de Son Montuno de Arsenio Rodríguez y lo arreglamos de forma distinta con puentes de ritmos y melodizaciones propias e influencias del Jazz tipo Big Band y el Rythm and Blues y, en el caso de Willie Colón, Roberto Rohena, y La Sonora Ponceña, hasta puentes de Bossa Nova. Yo veo la historia nuestra como la de un hermano menor con un hermano mayor que te enseñó mucho y del que aprendiste para luego tomar rumbo propio. Un abrazo y QUE VIVAN LOS ANTILLANOS.

Bad Bunny gave back to our people in a moment when we needed it the most, bridging generational gaps and reminding the world of the beauty of our homeland and culture. He breathed new life into the magic of salsa, creating a timeless anthem that not only celebrates who we are but also unites us. This is more than a song—it’s a gift to Puerto Rico and a reminder of why BB's status as an icon and a genuinely good human being is undeniable.

De la mata es una frase usada en muchos paises latinoamericanos para referirse a que uno proviene de donde se origina una cultura/costumbre/modo de comportamiento. Usualmente, no veras a gente usar esta expresion. Es muy rebuscada. Lo que mas vas a encontrar decir a la gente es "ese tipo es un CAIDO DE LA MATA", "esta en la mata", etc.  Este expresa que no estas avispado, te falta ponerte vivo, ponerte las pilas, no eres muy inteligente, un poco tonto.

## 🎵 Beautiful Things
**Artists:** Benson Boone

### 1. @loriskiba3921 (2752 chars)

> I fully agree!!! The passion and soulfullness has been missing from so many so-called singers anymore. Its a huge reason why I do love blues music and my 80-90s hard rock and metal bands! Benson Boone had to go independent to stay true to his brand of music.. but  dannng!! Its working for him as you can easily tell by the FILLED stadiums at his concerts!!! His music reminds me so much of the great, passion filled artists of the 80s and 90s!!! True singers like Perry from Journey are extremely hard to find, especially with this kind of range and depth of feeling!!! You feel it down to your soul in EVERY song! I can compare his passion with Oliver Anthony's.  2 completely different kinds of music, but the passion they feel and we feel is in their vocals and in the awesome talents they have backing them with the instruments being played too! Whether its simplistic as in a singular guitar, but that guitar carries the weight of the message behind the lyrics, or whether it's a full band sound with the drummer banging those drums so damn good and the lead guitarist ripping out the passion through his abilities and  the rhythm and bass guitars adding in everything else that is needed to make it all sound so full!!! My love for good music i was beginning to think was going to be lost in the realm of the blues artists I love to listen too, bc all of these 'popular pop artists" I cannot stand, mainly bc they all sound the exact same and have zero soul, zero passion.. but how could they? They're all controlled by scumbag agents and contracts only the devil himself makes. They sign their souls away without even knowing bc its all in the fine print no one looks at. I have found a deep love for all of the independent artists whether they're blues musicians, rappers, hard rock, heavy metal, or what people "claim" is country nowadays, or is actual country music,  etc.. as long as they can stay away from these evil labels and be strongly independent and keep all of the rights to their own music, it is a revolutionary change in how good music is getting out there! I will keep posting and reposting people like Benson Boone and many others to keep them exposed to the people in my social media groups! If I'm feeling their music is just that good to be posted and reposted, then y'all know its not just some run of the mill crap copied from original artists and repackaged as their own or its bc their lyrics have hit me so deep inside I HAVE to let others hear them and hopefully feel what I feel! Maybe they do, maybe they don't,  but either way, "music is the medicine" as Anthony Gomes says in his song! Yes, he is an amazing independent blues/rock artist.. y'all should take a listen too if ya have not heard of him before!  also!

It's been 8 days already and it feels like it's just been one long day, to me. This song was a song I used to sing to her, dont take away my beautiful things, well she is my everything in this life.

When I hear it play, I run into her room and WE DANCE, JUST LIKE WE ALWAYS DID AND ALWAYS WILL. I MISS YOU SO MUCH MONKEY. THANK YOU FOR MAKING ALL OF OUR LIVES SO VERY BEAUTIFUL. YOU ARE MEMORABLE. I CANT WAIT TO CELEBRATE YOUR BEAUTIFUL LIFE. WHAT A BLESSING IT IS TO Be YOUR MAMA, thank you for loving all of us, the way that you do, but our love was and always will be, special.

> At 40, Franz Kafka (1883-1924), who never married and had no children, walked through the park in Berlin when he met a girl who was crying because she had lost her favorite doll. She and Kafka searched for the doll unsuccessfully. Kafka told her to meet him there the next day and they would come back to look for her.  The next day, when they had not yet found the doll, Kafka gave the girl a letter "written" by the doll saying "please don't cry. I took a trip to see the world. I will write to you about my adventures."
Thus began a story which continued until the end of Kafka's life. During their meetings, Kafka read the letters of the doll carefully written with adventures and conversations that the girl found adorable. Finally, Kafka brought back the doll (he bought one) that had returned to Berlin. "It doesn't look like my doll at all," said the girl. Kafka handed her another letter in which the doll wrote: "my travels have changed me." the little girl hugged the new doll and brought the doll with her to her happy home.
A year later Kafka died. Many years later, the now-adult girl found a letter inside the doll. In the tiny letter signed by Kafka it was written:
"Everything you love will probably be lost, but in the end, love will return in another way."
Kafka really made some letters for a girl but details are unknown, this is a story written by Gerd Schneider in Kafka's Doll.
We are the way.

She'll come and stay the night, and I think I might have it all
And I thank God every day
For the girl he sent my way
But I know the things he gives me, he can take away
And I hold you every night
And that's a feeling I wanna get used to
But there's no man as terrified as the man who stands to lose you

> For a while there, it was rough
But lately, I've been doin' better
Than the last four cold Decembers
I recall

And I see my family every month
I found a girl my parents love
She'll come and stay the night
And I think I might have it all
And I thank God every day

For the girl He sent my way
But I know the things He gives me
He can take away
And I hold you every night

And that's a feelin' I wanna get used to

But there's no man as terrified
As the man who stands to lose you
Oh, I hope I don't lose you

Mm
Please stay

I want you, I need you, oh, God
Don't take
These beautiful things that I've got
Please stay
I want you, I need you, oh, God
Don't take
These beautiful things that I've got

Oh
Ooh
Please don't take
I found my mind, I'm feelin' sane
It's been a while, but I'm findin' my faith

If everything's good, and it's great
Why do I sit and wait 'til it's gone?
Oh, I'll tell ya, I know I've got enough
I've got peace, and I've got love
But I'm up at night thinkin'
I just might lose it all
Please stay
I want you, I need you, oh, God
Don't take
These beautiful things that I've got
Oh
Ooh
Please stay
I want you, I need you, oh, God
I need
These beautiful things that I've got

> « My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine. In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion. There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me, only an entity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable: I simply am not there» - average commentator under literally every music video

> I’m over here with a sinking feeling for u 😢 I pray u get thru this.. u will always remember and have beautiful memories.. not taking away your from your experience.. just want u to know Yu are not alone. I don’t have children (unfortunately) but I can only imagine how devastating it is for a parent to lose a child🙏🏼 I lost my dad when I was 21 to a hit and run on his Harley, and it was the worst experience of my life. He left behind me, my 13 yr old sister, and my 1 year old sister, and our mother. he was truly my best friend and my hero. It never goes away but gets a little easier over time.. but know that she is waiting for u and watches over u❤️ listening to beautiful songs like this, and letting it out does help, I’m 41 now and I still take rides in my car and put my dads fav songs on and think of all the beautiful things we did together, and the wisdom he had shared with me while growing up. I will keep u in my prayers 🙏🏼 and your beautiful daughter.. and we will all meet our loved ones one day❤️❤️

> God, I thank you for creating my amazing Nanny who died in 2011 when I was twelve. I have struggled so much in the last fourteen years since she died and struggled with a lot of anger towards You. Right now I am thanking You for giving me the kindest grandmother ever and for giving me the chance to get to know her. I thank you for her life. And I also thank you for my wonderful dog Max who died in the year 2017. Thank you so much for creating him. I’m so blessed to have had him as a pet. He was such a good dog. God, I repent for leaving You over and over again and being sad and depressed about my Nanny dying. I’m going to be grateful for my memories of her and I thank you for giving her life. I pray I will see her again when my time comes. And I will see my dog Max. ❤️

The 10 commandments are Gods laws 
We all have broken them
Time doesn’t erase past sins
Being sorry doesn’t erase past sins 
Not doing it again doesn’t erase the other times u did do it..
But God loves us so much he came down from the Heavens as a man .. his only begotten son born of a virgin 
Who came down to earth and took upon himself the punishment we deserve so we don’t have to .. I was not raised this way..i have experience things with God u wouldn’t believe if I told u..
Jesus loves u and if can just believe that and if you are truly sorry for your sins but this is key .. u must forgive everyone.. please.. no matter what they did ur not saying it’s ok your just trusting God to handle it✝️🙏❤️🔥🥹🥹🥹🥹

> I thought your chorus that I was hearing on social media was catchy. Then my wife listened to the song wholly and played it blindly for me. There is not a single song that I've ever heard that speaks of the desperation of holding dear to the things we ALREADY HAVE with an almost painful importance. There is not a song in this world in my 33 years here that has spoken so closely from my heart. This song is astounding. It is exactly what my heart feels. It is exactly every worry that I carry daily. The chorus is catchy, but until you hear the verses-- it doesn't sink in. Please stay, I want you I need you. Oh God, don't take these beautiful things that I've got. I hope you continue the most successful of careers writing music that touches the heart so deeply.

> I'm so sorry for your pain and having to go thru something that words can't relay the pain your feeling,  losing a child is the one thing we shouldn't have to endure in our lifetime, we're supposed to go first. The one thing that will heal your heart is knowing she's at peace and free from the health issues she had here on earth, she's flying high threw the heavens smiling down, watching over you. Try watching some of ppls near death experiences, I've found so much peace with death just from listening to ppl tell how beautiful heaven is, how the love you feel is like no other. Just something that my help u thru. You are in my prayers, an I pray you get through this horrific time and find peace. My condolences

> 387 days without drugs a little drink time to time but never like before
She was great and we tried it for 4 months but things didnt work out
But hey i am still alive and well 
Thanks to everyone who rooted for my shit even its just a little utube comment
And if anyone is reading this comment i wish the best of things that life can offer u can give up drugs
But ive learnt that connecting with the right people is the cure to it not staying sober for the sake of being sober
I was in a very dark spot when i wrote that first comment
But if you believe, try and truly want better life for u things change but you gotta have the power and patience to change it
Sincerely Gaz the Mongorian ❤️☺️

> My daughter is turning six this month.  She has cerebellum hyperplasia and secondary autism. I have no words for your loss as just imagining it makes me empty and dead inside. I fight like he'll for my babies and can't imagine the hell I'd feel without them. One thing I know for sure is that God doesn't make mistakes. He has his own plans for each and every one of us. We do survive the hell our heart can take us to in loss. We do become capable of laughing and smiling at memories that crushed us. We can't forget the way our loved one wanted to see us and live that version for the sake of their memories. She's on the other side free of pain and waiting on her mommy!❤

My hubby and I been married for 23 years and going through tough times last Fall; and I went visit him at his house and we had made up s***; and when I was leaving to go back home to my house this song just popped up right on time I was driving further and further away from him and it felt like this song was sending me a message from him!  I couldn't believe it my ears!  I'm an 80s baby and I'm a Rock fan; and this Rock is Badass!!!  I Love this song and it was the first time I heard it Fall, last year!

I miss her so much now.. I’ve never been religious and this song just describes my situation as well.. but I can’t help but feel pain hearing it ☹️😢😩😭😭😭💔… it still doesn’t feel real 😢 but the pain very much does..

I hope you and your family are doing well  😢❤️‍🩹❤ my condolences 💐

> If you don't make it, this isn't the end. I can't prove it to you, but I believe it to my core. We are eternal souls wrapped in a meat suit so that we can experience this world. Touch, taste, smell, etc. "You" never die. Just the body you're in right now dies. I pray you recover but like everything else in this world, we're taught the opposite of the truth. We're lied to from cradle to grave. We're taught to fear death. There's nothing to fear. You would just be continuing your journey. And you'll be aware of it the entire time. I really hope this brought you or anyone else going through something similar some comfort. It really will be alright.

> Beautiful things by Benson Boone
This song reminds me of my wife. She passed away on May 16, 2025, because of cancer.
I’ve never felt pain like this in my entire life. I thought that as the days went by, it would slowly get better—but it hasn’t. Today marks 68 days without her, and the pain is still as heavy as ever.

We were just a simple couple. All we wanted was to grow old together, to watch our kids succeed and have families of their own.

I wish it had been me instead of her. I know deep in my heart that our kids would’ve been better if she were still here and not me. God I love my wife so much that it hurts so much 😢 to this day.

They said it is the “good” cancer but we dont know what the future this disease might bring. Im still grateful I have my wonderful husband and son with me, I still got a roof over my head, food on the table, energy to still work. I may not have all the material wealth in this world, but I am happy and my heart is full ❤ Im not happy with the cancer, but it made me realize I have everything I need. I pray that God wont take away all the beautiful things that I got. Thank you for this heartfelt song. ❤

> I love how the song is like a beautiful, desperate cry to wish for the moments of bliss to last a little longer, knowing that nothing lasts forever. It's about appreciating what you finally have and how it feels so good it makes you scared of losing it all. I think that's what makes human life even more meaningful and delicate – knowing that everything can be taken away from you at any given time. So, if you're reading this, hug them tighter, spend time with them a little longer. The most beautiful things in life are felt in the most subtle ways, which most people tend to overlook. Don't miss the chances you have.

That's that me, espresso
Is it that sweet? I guess so
I'm working late 'cause I'm a singer
Oh, he looks so cute wrapped around my finger
My twisted humor, make him laugh so often
My honey bee, come and get this pollen
Too bad your ex don't do it for ya
Walked in and dream came trued it for ya
Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya
I know I Mountain Dew it for ya
That morning coffee, brewed it for ya
One touch and I brand newed it for ya
Now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
Is it that sweet? I guess so
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me, espresso
Move it up, down, left, right, oh
Switch it up like Nintendo
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me, espresso
He's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
Is it that sweet? I guess so
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me, espresso

> Lyrics

[Chorus]
Now he's thinking 'bout me every night, oh
Is it that sweet? I guess so
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
Move it up, down, left, right, oh
Switch it up like Nintendo
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso

[Verse 1]
I can't relate to desperation
My give-a-fucks are on vacation
And I got this one boy and he won't stop calling
When they act this way, I know I got 'em

[Pre-Chorus]
(Mm) Too bad your ex don't do it for ya
(Mm) Walked in and dream-came-trued it for ya
(Mm) Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya
(Yes) I know I Mountain Dew it for ya
(Yes) That morning coffee, brewed it for ya
(Yes) One touch and I brand-newed it for ya (Ooh)

[Chorus]
And now he's thinking 'bout me every night, oh
Is it that sweet? I guess so
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
Move it up, down, left, right, oh
Switch it up like Nintendo
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso

[Post-Chorus]
Holy shit
Is it that sweet? I guess so (Mm)

[Verse 2]
I'm working late cause I'm a singer
Oh, he looks so cute wrapped 'round my finger
My twisted humor make him laugh so often
My honeybee, come and get this pollen

[Pre-Chorus]
(Mm) Too bad your ex don't do it for ya
(Mm) Walked in and dream-came-trued it for ya
(Mm) Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya (Ayy, ayy, oh)
(Yes) I know I Mountain Dew it for ya
(Yes) That morning coffee, brewed it for ya
(Yes) One touch and I brand-newed it for ya (Stupid)

[Chorus]
Now he's thinking 'bout me every night, oh
Is it that sweet? I guess so
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
Move it up, down, left, right, oh
Switch it up like Nintendo
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso (Yes)
Thinking 'bout me every night, oh
Is it that sweet? I guess so (Yes)
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso (Yes)
Move it up, down, left, right, oh (Move it up, down, left, right, oh)
Switch it up like Nintendo (Yes)
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso

[Outro]
Is it that sweet? I guess so
Mm, that's that me espresso

> @NEWS Channel 10: ‼️The song “Espresso” that Sabrina Carpenter claims was invented by her was in its entirety stolen from another artist. Yes, you heard that right, every single word down to the chorus and lyrics to the idea of the video location and technique were not originally from any of the people mentioned to have created the song, including Sabrina Carpenter. Sabrina Carpenter stole this song and put it off as her own and gave no credit to the abused victim from whom she illegally took it from, earning her millions of dollars and fans and billions of views, meanwhile giving its original creator (a man) zero credit. This is evidence of a theft in the music industry. But more than that, it raises questions such as: If she steals numerous songs and passes them off as her own, how much of her fame and wealth is she really entitled to? And what is she and her team of fake artists doing to suppress the silent victims she is abusing and hurting?

>  @Kai88988 the thing people still don’t get is Carti is a punk rapper. He does to rap what Punks did to rock. Minimalist, mocking the overtly dense lyricism, and keeping it to basics. He thinks most of what rappers say is all the same so he jumbles the words and deconstruct them and focused more on melody. My musicology Prof considers what Carti does as in the same spirit of the Dadaist art movement. Or like the Cubist deconstructionist art movement of focusing on more abstract concepts than the dense philosophies. I know people will say it may be reading too much but it’s actually what we’re seeing with these rappers insulted as “mumble rappers.” It’s just a punk rap movement that undermines the mainstream conception of Hip Hop and corporate industry. Again what punks did for rap using minimalist cords and DIY attitudes

He always sent her greetings through a radio station where his friend worked, until one day they told him to play it quickly, and he had dedicated this song to her ❤ I always wanted to meet him, until my mom told me he had died in 97, she was devastated back then, with good reason, he was incredible and much more, they deserved a great future, to be a happy couple and have a family❤.

>  @dropthealbummike8713 heartless is the greatest song on the album because it was different. Only way you wouldn’t choose heartless is if you don’t like bad words due to still being in the womb and not being in the real world or if your too old that you don’t relate to partying anymore. Tell me what other song then heartless you can play at a party from the album. Also snow child was probably the worst song. Bro didn’t change the beat. That’s a depressing song not because you get a sad emotion but because you just feel like life has no joy in it.

Edit: I listened to this song maybe 40 times and about 20 times in a row yesterday in a rental car... I didn't really watch the video until now and wow now I feel like I'm haunted or scared or something but I don't think weekend is evil but maybe the other guy might be because he looks so unfriendly...

> Did you know you can live forever? Jesus, the Son of God, gave His life for us. He was sacrificed for our sins and was resurrected. Repent, follow Jesus, and live forever! He loves you, and has made a new home for you in Heaven!

- If you want to learn more about Jesus and how to live forever, check out the Gospel (the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) within the New Testament of the Holy Bible. Each book is an eye witness account of the miracles He performed, His death, resurrection, and His promise to you!

> Ya'll, I can't tell you how much I love The Weeknd. Since I first listened to Crew Love, I instantly knew this man would be famous. I listened to him even before that, and his mixtapes have been on Soundcloud since 2011. Had XO tatted on my body since 2016. He's my favorite artist, and he is still to this day. You have no idea how much of an influence he has on me, and to see him at this level is just amazing. I said, "He will be famous, I know it," while listening to his mixtapes and the whole Trilogy album.

How dare you say, If I was you I would cut off my wrist”  when you get constipated and don’t know what it really is pushing out 6lbs of a human being. Whose “Wrist” took ‘9’month to form. Garbage fame but an eternal price for souls hurt by your lyrics. Repent from such evil. I stand by it. This is one of the reasons suicide is prevalent in the is USA. Such complete day light Evil.

Focus on gratitude. You are a powerful source of energy. When you do this, you will get what you want because you are in alignment and focusing on all you have instead of a lack. Just know you have everything you have ever wanted. It’s already yours . Be joyful! Sending loving energy to you all. ❤️

> The weekend is also a writer. His first album shows his personal creativity much more than this, but this chorus IS his style. The one he's utilized from day one that's served him quite well. He has a great understanding of the drama that a vocal melody can induce through his type of voice and he really leans into it. I'm here for it too. Especially through the media that producers like Pharell offer.

That almost spiritual feeling in your chest. +10pts if you're with someone you're feelin. And the look you give them as you stare into their eyes while the songs bumps hard AF. Yeah theres a reason it feels magical. It's because it is magic....black satanic magic.

His vocals and themes, to the intense scenes and visuals, (well these visuals specificaly are ummm.... something 💀) are next level. Good job as always, and LOVE FROM CANADA BABY!!!!!

In that time a generation is forgotten. But I understand the point. “Legend “ in terms of the best singer of this time right now. Not too literal though.

> @ I would have to agree. A diagnosis certainly does not make someone abusive. I’m sure that we both can agree that what makes a person abusive is that person and their choice to hurt someone they’re suppose to love, in the most soul crushing ways where you feel your chest caving in on itself and the tight knot deep in the pit of your stomach just keeps getting tighter and tighter. The type of abuse that leaves you astounded, mortified and confused  by the level of cruelty from someone who, just 5 minutes ago kissed your forehead, wrapped you in their arms and whispers “thank you god”  Someone who wouldn’t let you lift a thing this morning showing genuine affection then it’s like a split happens, he is replaced with the “other” guy… who will spit in your face, call you every name in the book, threats of violence that occasionally turn into promises. A person who admits that since the very first time calling you a name, they knew it was going to get worse. 
I don’t know what the diagnosis for that would be. I asked him to see a professional to talk to, to help him heal from childhood trauma. He turned it around d that I was the problem and he had none. What was mine was his, and his was his. He weaponized my past traumas and mistakes. Man, this dude was so fucked up… I had gotten severely sick one time and  in so much pain. He seriously was telling me that I was faking it  I called my mama and she got on the phone with him chewing him out and telling him to get me to an ER.  I was septic and told I had about a day left if I didn’t go in for medical care. I spent 5 days in the hospital. Never came to visit me. On the day of my discharge, I spoke to him twice about what time he needed to be there to pick me up. He did not show up. I waited out in the sidewalk for 2 hours in the hot summer heat, still in a bit of pain. My mom ended up picking me up. I can write a book on all of the shit he put me through. At the end of the day, I allowed it. I truly believed if I loved him enough or if I tried different communication methods or if I showed up exactly how he wanted me to..nothing ever satisfied. Then I started googling relationship advice after many requests for couples counseling were dismissed, google kept popping up info about NPD. The more and more I read, the more and more it was making sense. The hardest realization that hurts the most is the closure I will never get, never a show of remorse or accountability. That this person honestly believes that he is in the right, even with the physical violence, I “made him do it.” 
Even though most of the time I was not given an explanation for the reason of the outbursts of rage. All I could do was sit there and cry as I was being screamed at. Then demands that I respond, then  physically threatened and sometimes attacked for “running my mouth”  like I said I could write a book

You know I'm impatient
So why would you leave me waitin' outside the station
When it was like minus four degrees?
And I, I get what you're sayin'
I just really don't wanna hear it right now
Can you shut up for like once in your life?
Listen to me, I took your nice words of advice about
How you think I'm gonna die lucky if I turn 33
Okay, so yeah, I smoke like a chimney
I'm not skinny, and I pull a Britney every other week
But cut me some slack, who do you want me to be?
'Cause I'm too messy, and then I'm too fucking clean
You told me, "Get a job, " then you ask where the hell I've been
And I'm too perfect 'til I open my big mouth
I want to be me, is that not allowed?
And I'm too clever, and then I'm too fucking dumb
You hate it when I cry, unless it's that time of the month
And I'm too perfect 'til I show you that I'm not
A thousand people I could be for you, and you hate the fucking lot
You hate the fucking lot
You hate the fucking lot
You hate, you hate
It's taking you ages
You still don't get the hint, I'm not askin' for pages
But one text or two would be nice
And please, don't pull those faces
When I've been out working my arse off all day
It's just one bottle of wine or two
But, hey, you can't even talk
You smoke weed just to help you sleep
Then why you out gettin' stoned at four o'clock?
And then you come home to me
And don't say hello, 'cause I got high again
And forgot to fold my clothes
'Cause I'm too messy, and then I'm too fucking clean
You told me, "Get a job, " then you ask where the hell I've been
And I'm too perfect 'til I open my big mouth
I want to be me, is that not allowed?
And I'm too clever, and then I'm too fucking dumb
You hate it when I cry, unless it's that time of the month

> I can attest to trauma like that causing brain changes and health issues. I grew up with various forms of abuse and manipulation with a bpd mom. It’s a long story, but I think I have C-PTSD from my childhood, especially when my actual life was being threatened on and off where I thought I was gonna be killed. Then another day it would be happy and normal. No wonder I picked psycho guys 🤣🤣 I had no identity and was a love addict who chased guys nonstop for 10-11 years, 9 relationships. I couldn’t even stop talking to guys cuz I was addicted. Haven’t been in a relationship or hooked up with anyone in 2 years, healed a lot, learned boundaries, started understanding myself and forming my own identity. When you have a bpd parent, you are an extension of them and don’t really get the chance to have a sense of self, so it takes a lot of work to heal those things. However, I have permanent mental illness that will never go away cuz of having trauma during brain development as a child. And also, I dated narcissists, cheaters, liars, and so many horrible men. Guess what eventually happened? I went through all of that my entire life and other things that made the past few years harder. I get back on meds, I gain like 100 lbs, my already existing health issues get really bad, etc. I kept telling everyone that I think after 26-27 years of trauma, my body just shut down. For a whole year I struggled with having even enough energy to shower or microwave a meal. I was mostly in bed dealing with fatigue and multiple health issues. 
So I think you’re right, it messes up your brain and body.

I plan to lose weight for health purposes cuz I can’t do as much shit with this extra weight, and I don’t wanna be doing no fun stuff by the time I’m 30 cuz of having a hard time getting around. I know I can improve stuff in my mental and physical health, but I also accept the permanent damage and changes that cannot be changed or reversed. There has to be some form of acceptance to make peace with stuff.

Anyway, didn’t mean to write this much, but I related so much and wanted to validate what you were saying.

I hope you’re doing better! Fuck that guy and the psycho dudes out there. We deserve better! We got this! 💕💕

> Sending you both so much love and strength. You've already done the hardest part...SEEING it and FEELING it for what it is. You WILL make it through. Be kind and patient with yourself. It may take time to fully leave and to fully heal, but you will make it. And you have a tribe of other humans who are here for you any time you need for validation and support! It's no coincidence that somehow all of us who have survived narcissists have managed to find this song right when we need it most. There's nothing harder than learning to love yourself after a narcissist has has their way with you. And it's not your fault...you were only a target because of the love you have and your light. So no matter what, keep shining your light. Even if it feels a bit dim at times, let it flicker at its own pace and accept it for where its at, because you are the light. Give your light the oxygen it needs to stay lit. Breathe. Then breathe some more. Release. Forgive yourself. Love yourself. Then breathe again. It will come back full force, brighter than EVER!

>  @ayanami66  Yes! It's both! No matter who you are or how strong you are, living in today's world is living in a narcissistic based society. But not all of us are victims of narcissists one on one. That's a special kind of evil to prevail over. I think the most empathetic and loving people tend to become victims of "personal" narcs, whether it's always dating people who don't actually love you, let alone LIKE you, or always taking jobs for less than you're worth, or letting your boss speak to you certain ways, etc...we just want others to be happy. We don't plot ways of taking others down or plot ways to overtake the world just so WE can have more to ourselves. That's what has made us victims...up until NOW. I think we are all feeling a deep, stirring within and finally have had enough. We're no longer going to continue to be victims of people who only want to use others for their gain. Be it society, the government, your mother, uncle, "best" friend, fiance, spouse, child, etc...We're breaking free.

> Just reading the comments, I want to say there is a difference between people who have narcissistic traits and people who have NPD. Most people have some narcissistic traits, but that doesn’t mean they are narcissist. It is a very specific diagnosis and accounts for roughly 0.2-3 % of the population. So it is not as common as people think. Yes, your ex (or others in your life) might have exhibited signs of narcissism but that doesn’t make them narcissists. It has become a catch all for someone who treats you badly. Unfortunately for those who actually have to deal with people with NPD it makes things harder because people think it’s easy to get over or escape the grips of a narcissist. Yes 75% of people who have NPD are men but that doesn’t mean most men are narcissists. It’s 75% of 0.2-3%  of people. From someone who is in therapy with someone with NPD please don’t label people narcissistic if they just exhibit traits and don’t have NPD because it is not helpful.

> Ты же знаешь, что я нетерпеливая,
Зачем тогда бросил меня ждать перед вокзалом,
Когда на улице было минус четыре?
Я всё прекрасно понимаю, 
Просто сейчас я не хочу слышать этих слов,
Можешь хоть раз в жизни заткнуться?
Послушай,
Я приняла твой "добрый" совет о том,
Какой смертью, по-твоему, я умру,
И что мне повезёт, если я доживу до тридцати трёх.
Ну да, я дымлю, как паровоз,
Я не худышка и раз в неделю срываюсь, 
Как Бритни Спирс,
Но будь ко мне поснисходительней,
Какой мне для тебя стать?
Потому что я то слишком неряшливая,
То пи**ец чистюля.
Ты твердил: "Найди работу!"
А теперь спрашиваешь, где я пропадала.
И вообще я просто идеальная,
Пока не раскрою свою пасть,
Я хочу быть собой,
Или такое не дозволяется?
То я слишком умничаю,
То я пи**ец тупая,
Тебя бесит, когда я пла́чу,
Если только у меня не "эти дни".
И вообще я просто идеальная,
Пока не докажу, что это не так,
Я могу сделаться для тебя тысячей разных людей,
Но ты ненавидишь их всех.

> ​ @RoystonVasey1  Not true lol. There's usually a victim of narcissistic parents to narcissistic boyfriend/gf pipeline. When you were a victim to narc parents you're primed to accept a narc lover bc you think that's what love is. 

My parents were both narcs/sociopaths. I escaped home at age 16, only to be in a relationship with an older narc man who abused me for 10 years. Luckily I survived somehow. 

When you're used to being abused then you accept abuse from others way too easily, bc it's considered normal to you. Until you finally realize you're being abused & that you deserve better. 

Also victims can display traits of narcs bc they're learned & considered normal. Trauma can cause this behavior. The difference tho is that non-narcs have the ability to self-crit & reflect, then improve. Actual narcs lack self reflection.

> My 6 year old daughter has ADHD. I heard the chorus and my heart broke for her. Mom-guilt of juggling between her highs and lows and trying to figure out who she is and how I can support her and love her through it. 

My daughter is so damn smart; she is so intense in every aspect of her life. She is so “too much” for everyone around her, and oftentimes for herself. My daughter is so beautiful (truly, gorgeous baby), but when she shows her true colors and is not what others expect her to be, my heart breaks as her mother to see their faces sour. 

We’re learning how to allow her to be herself yet teach her how to function and thrive in a world that doesn’t understand her. It is exhausting for me, but especially for her. 

Thank you, Lola, for writing an anthem for little girls like mine.

> Our past reflections of two strangers who shared the same life somewhere else in the world, in the past and now the present. You don't know how happy I am for you that you found yourself again and then some. It's easy to see when life's not cloudy stuck in a full fog. I found my happiness too, I also want to keep it forever. I never knew I could do so many things, a mother, a good wife, learn trades and crafts. Do things you always wanted to try but were too low to even put in the effort. Either the experience breaks you or it teaches you and you become better for it, more resilient. I'm 33! Life never felt so good as it does now. I'm glad you found yourself and your happiness with someone that returns the love you give. Truly. 😊

> @ You’re right. He could very well not be a narc…. He is definitely a manipulative, mentally and physically abusive,  extremely toxic individual. He has his good side though… he was so good, nice, and charming to everyone else. Go out of his way to help others unless it was something I needed help with. This manipulative, mentally and physically abusive, extremely toxic individual would talk shit about me behind back to our friends, tell them I was this lazy POS who didn’t clean when the truth was he was like a 6’2” toddler throwing temper tantrums if I told him no and would completely turn everything upside down, and I would clean up his mess because he didn’t think he should have to do “housework” He was a complete mindfuck.

> I’m sorry you’ve gone through that!! 💕I had a narcissistic ex I only dated a few months, I had an abusive relationship besides that one for 9 months, and the rest of my exes were completely toxic.

This song is definitely how I felt growing up with a mother with bpd and childhood trauma and then the trauma I faced with many men I’ve dated. I’ve spent a couple years healing and single, and I’m doing much better. So I really feel and understand this song. I completely relate to it. Growing up never good enough, and then dating men who continued that narrative that I wasn’t good enough. Men trying to change me all the time. This song makes me feel strong in my healing and makes me even more so protect my peace no matter what.

I felt that because I always had to be the supporter I could never complain or say that my job was hard because he works harder and his body hurts more than mine and he is the king and should be treated as such, but even when it was that time of the month I could barley catch a break he would even have the audacity to tell me I should get up and go for a walk or do something other than lay down because he literally thought he knew how cramps felt and how to make them go away even when I would tell him what I knew would make me feel better he would always have to have the last word and say no I think you you need this..

Smexy times just haven't been the same. 😢 My boss wasn't sure about this song (as if he had a choice 😅), but during the company meeting with foreign investors, when they asked me my opinion on which direction we should go, I literally couldn't do anything other than bust out my boombox and play this song at full volume! Interestingly, the investors agreed to the contract, with the condition that I never stop playing this song. I literally couldn't help but oblige.

And now I’m having a breakdown again, I gain weight and I feel like I’m having depression again, I don’t even wanna go out my house anymore. This is hitting me in hard places, I think all this time my autoconcept was dictated by the pretty standrs, and how I would never be that beautiful or that gorgeous as is accepted. And I just realize that I’ve never loved myself and never accepted myself. I just wanna stop thinking I’m gross, messy, and horrendous. That’s why this song entered my soul.

> "Sounds like being in a relationship with a  narcissist." Maybe, but maybe not. I think it's easier to see yourself as a victim when the truth is in most relationships both people are the bad guys at some points. Maybe she did write this song to free herself from a narcissistic relationship, but I choose to listen to it as a rejection of expectations. Social media and the internet in general give us the impression we're supposed to be a specific person, that we live one life and that's it. That we have to be too perfect. The truth is most people exist in multitudes. We're messy,  we're not perfect. And that's fine.

> Society hasnt been starving for music like this it has always been made but big media want to continually play outdated shite that wasn't  good in the first place instead of letting new artist wirh a message shine. Metal and Hard rock is perfect example there have been bands coming out every year since the grunge age that literally made the grunge aged barely a shit stain on the map. Yet they continue to play the shit from that era on the radios 30 years later. Metal has been release righteous tunes with lyrical  substance for 60+ but continues to get drowned out by horseshit bands that disappear inna few years.

> ​ @RoystonVasey1  It wouldn't surprise me, because the singer seems a bit narcissistic to me. She is impatient, so why did you keep her waiting. Red flag. If you are impatient deal with it yourself, it's your problem. And then: she gets what you're saying, but doesn't want to hear it right now, can you shut up for once in your life? Red flag. She knows you are right, but doesn't want to hear the truth and very toxically tells you to shut up. 
I don't know whether she sings these lines to show us that she isn't perfect either or she's just a narcissist who thinks that it is fair to act the way she says she does.

> Sounds like Me. I dont leave the house unless I'm Opiatated and already a 6 pack in.... Crazy how I drove under the influence of opiates weed and  alcohol  and never got a OVI/DUI until i got sober for the first and only short period of time. Lol in my lady friends car with no keys in it, no drugs, no alcohol. Lol. I was working out at a park (working out became my new "Drug".) Anyway, was working out at a park. I started not to feel good. My friend was just reading getting some sun, I went to sit down in the car for a mintue. She only hit the unlock button for me one time which unlocks the driver door only. So I sat there in the driver seat. After I didnt come back for ? How' ever long, she came to check on me and i was unconcious , breathing but just not responding to her words, or her slaps to my face lol.  So she called emergency services. The dispatcher is asking her questions about health issues or drug use etc. Well she told them that she knew I USED to be opiate dependent in the past. Anyway, So I guess the info was passed along and this COP shows up AFTER the firetruck and ambulance, this cops just keeps repeating that we have a over dose. Even tho the EMTS and fire fighter keep telling him that its not,  if it was id be discolored and have trouble breathing etc. But he doesn't care. I mean they told him at LEAST ten times. No its not no it's not.  He actually follows the ambulance to the hospital, and I woke up 14 hours later with paper work and a citation saying I got charged with OVI and refusal of chemical test, even tho in Cincinnati Ohio is against the law to charge unconscious people with refusal of chemical test. The cop ALSO told the nurses at the hospital that I overdosed and wrecked and totalled my car. Which wasnt true, I was never driving, no cars were wrecked at all, he was just a liar. He even signed my own name for me on the citation which is illegal AF! But of course I get a shittie judge who just over looked all the laws the cop broke. So in court 18 months and 9 THOUSAND DOLLARS in Lawyer fees later. the judge asks me "So Mr Smith. How long were you under the influence if drugs and alcohol. " i said im clean now but I was unsober for EIGHT years . The judge then says "EIGHT YEARS!?! AND NO CRIMINAL HISTORY! SO YOUVE JUST BEEN GETTING AWAY WITH THIS THE WHOLE TIME! GUILTY!!!" and that was that.   The Sheriff Deputy who was working the court room walked me and my lawyer and my witness (friend) out into the hallway. He SUPRISINGLY told us that he had never seen anything like that before, he never witnessed anyone get a DUI/OVI without driving much less without keys in a parked car.. he also said he's never seen someone have all the evidence on their side and still get convicted especially when the officers own words on his discovery dont match the words on my citation.. Cop wrote "keys found in ignition engine running". even tho in the body cam that we watched in court SHOWS him taking them from my friend. Also, the cop advised me in the future if I'm ever needing to go to court for something again, DO NOT AGREE TO A BENCH TRIAL when you want a JURY TRIAL! Especially at the end of the day when the JUDGE was ready to go home.. becauae I was the very last court proceeding of that entire day and the cop said that he knew the judge was getting ready to leave the court house and then I agreed to the bench trial and he had to stay longer. He had to let my lawyer play the body cam video , when she asked if she could play the officers body cam video, the Judge LITERALLY said "IF YOU MUST." 
It was just so unprofessional and crazy,  I felt like I was in some twisted movie.! 
I WANTED a JURY trial the entire time, but every single court date, for 18 months, the judge would hold me until the very end of the day AFTER the jury went home and he'd then tell my lawyer that I could do a BENCH trial... which, is VERY ODD because in COURT, at least here in Hamilton County, Cincinnati, Ohio, the people with court dates go in alphabetical order! But for me that didnt apply.! . ALSO, USUALLY.! The people with PAID lawyers are suppose to go FIRST! Before people with PUBLIC DEFENDERS, but again, for some reason that didnt apply to me.... 

Anyway, the reason I agreed to do the bench trial was because I felt that they would never give me a chance to have a JURY trial. Also, everytime we went to court, which was at LEAST once a month for 18 months, I had to pay my layer $475 just to sit next to me from like 8:30-9:00 AM to about 2:30-3:30 PM. Not to mention, every single time I went to court I was dragging my friend along with me, she missed at LEAST 18 days of work trying to defend me against this crooked system, PLUS everytime im sitting in court I'm not making money or living my life either.!!!!
So i agreed to the bench trial! Because it seemed I had no other choice.!

I was convicted on everything, even tho i had proff of innocence, witnesses and PROFF the cop lied about many things. ESPECIALLY since he told two different stories in his own paper work! 

I was convicted of both charges "OVI" and "Refusal of chemical test" (even tho i was never asked to take one and was NEVER CONCIOUS in the presence OF THE OFFICER or THE EMTs / FIRE FIGHTERS.! 
I was maxed out on everything! Even tho this was my first convictions in Cincinnati/Ohio in 29 YEARS! 
Maxed out punishment for my first conviction in 29 YEARS! the city i grew up in.
Wow, this whole thing was just a nightmare.

 After the fact i figure out,  Apparently, people are intimidated by this judge. I've heard "they run the city." His brother was the Major of Cincinnati.  So yeah, I guess it makes more sense now.... 
crooked Cincinnati where innocent people get the cook thrown at them for their first convictions and anyone whos been getting felonies since they were teenagers gets lightest of sentences. GOT IT.!
Orrr, do I.? Maybe this has to do with something else.. . . .

What Jesus has to say Brad Arnold, the lead singer of 3 Doors Down, has died at 47 💔🙏

What Jesus has to say about a Great 👍 
A Great Band 👏 Have some HITS 🎯 R.I.P.

Our smartphones are turning into obituary column ::so that means ☝️
Young children 🌱 of the world 🌍 become a life insurance agent 💵 Go door 🚪 to door 🚪 
The world needs a policy 👌
Imagine eight billion people with your life insurance policy you will be a Multi billionaire 💵👌
1. House insurance/ Alarm system insurance 
2 . Car insurance 
3. Fire insurance 
4. Health insurance 
5. Disability insurance you can no longer work you cripple or a Quadriplegic 
6. Every time you turn around; you need a Lawyer/ Attorney 

But what is life really saying 

Hebrews 9:27
27 And as it is appointed unto men and women once to die, but after this the judgment

◄ Psalm 116:15 ►
Precious in the sight of the LORD JESUS CHRIST is the death of his faithful servants.

Life is saying we gotta die from this world 🌍 because of Sin and wickedness and disease:; the World 🌍 must stand before GOD JESUS CHRIST! Get Saved John 3:16/17 there is another life;; after Planet Earth 🌍 🤙 

You as an individual Handsome Male or Beautiful Female of the 8 Billion people around the world 🌎 want to be part of this Great multitude in the Future 👀 

The Great Multitude in White Robes
Rev 7:9 After this I looked, and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands.

◄ Revelation 22:7 ►
Behold, I JESUS CHRIST come quickly: blessed is he or she that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this Holy Bible book 📖 of Mines.

Revelation 22:14
14 Blessed are individuals of Males and females they that do his Jesus Christ commandments on the Planet Earth, that they may have right to the tree of life to Eat, and may enter in through the New Jerusalem Israel 🇮🇱 pearly gates into the city


I will never add to the Bible God asked me to help you understand the scriptures it's an ancient book I'm writing it for the year 2026
◄ Ezekiel 3:18 ►
When I Jesus Christ your LORD and Savior says to a good person, wicked person, unbeliever of the cross person‘You will surely die,’ and you Believers of the cross of minds on the Earth and do not warn them or speak out to dissuade them from their evil ways,  in order to save their life, that wicked person, or good person and unbelievers and Believers of mine who turned away will die for their sin, and I will hold you accountable for their blood.

As you read through this Gospel you will find that eternal life comes not by doing, but by believing:...
" Whoever believes in Me has Eternal life" 
( John 6:47)

◄ Hebrews 8:12 ►
For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.”

If you have not accepted Jesus Christ as your savior, you can do that right now, just open your heart to him and pray this prayer....

" Jesus, thank you for coming to save me.
 I know I've made mistakes and have tried to do things on my own for too long. So, in the midst of this New Year 2026 season, I give my life to you, I believe that you died on the cross for my sins and rose from the dead. Today, I start out my new life as a part of your family. Thank you for a fresh start!"
Amen 🙌

> Iris❤ 2026
Song by Goo Goo Dolls ‧ 1998
I'm glad she's fired and trust me it's not going to be easy finding a real paying nurse Job 

'MAKE THEIR LIVES MISERABLE': A nurse was fired from the hospital at Virginia Commonwealth University after posting videos that encouraged drugging and harming ICE agents.

In the videos, she promoted so-called “sabotage” and “resistance” tactics — including filling syringes with paralytic drugs and spiking drinks.

My Words 🤔 Her Comment should not be allowed on Social media Platforms: and she should be arrested: that's a national threat 😕 But it's a Sign 🛑 of the Evil End Times and which we live 🙏 
I have worked at a Hospital 🏥💊🛏️ for a little bit ! But my Mom was a Good Heart 🫀 Nurse: took care of the Good and bad people who needed To be checked! Out her steady paycheck 💵 help to take care of me until I was 18 etc 
 But today we have Some bad Nurses who are not right 🤬☝️ 
Did many things to Me when I worked and 🤬☝️ needed treatment! If the hospital is not using a Vein illuminator! To help with IV do not allow them to keep sticking you with needles 💉
I can't post what goes on in a Hospital 🏥 behind closed doors!! It's a Business Administration 👀 ☝️ The pharmaceutical companies in the CDC centers for disease Control and prevention:; all of them doing things to our Air in the sky: and our medicine and food and drinks 🤬 They have the cure for all the diseases ! But how can they make money 💵 off of Healthy people ☝️
I have posted numerous messages about please if you have good healthcare benefits: please go get checked out! Yes inside and out! Especially your Heart EKG check up and blood pressure check up 🫀 Lungs 🫁  Brain 🧠, and Blood 🩸 flowing throughout Your body will save the Whole Entire World 🌎 
Well you will never understand what I'm trying to say!! I hope this clarifies it 
When Jesus Christ finally returns and sets up his kingdom and makes it right I cannot wait to see them all on the unemployment line!!

Someone said 
You don’t have to agree with what they’re doing but you never threaten harm to a federal agent or any other person. Especially being a nurse. You took an oath to not harm and to help.

Someone said 
I heard some of those comments that have been made by nurses and others and it’s heartbreaking!
When people say and do that, they’ve lost their soul… and if you wondered what that looks like there you go!

Someone said 
Glad for this. Her actions don't represent myself or the million other medical professionals that support law and order. We stand beside our brothers and sisters in LE and front line heroes.

My Words 🤔 America 🇺🇲👌 is a beautiful place 
But we have had a border Crisis: before I was born! People have been sneaking in America 🇺🇲 and taking our Jobs 🤬☝️ Working for real peanuts 🥜 and our Government has given more foreigners grants and loans for businesses 
What happened to helping Just Americans who need the same help 👌
I will be here all day talking 
I just say 
Black history is coming February month 
Abraham Lincoln took a bullet for me 
He freed slaves ☝️
John f Kennedy stood for me 
Malcolm X;; I can listen to him talk all day and he took a bullet for me 
Martin Luther King Jr what he stood 
And now he's 97 in heaven and you know what he will say about ICE 2026
You know what Nelson Mandela would say about America and Africa 
You know what Gandhi of India was say about America 
I will be here all day 24/7/365 talking about 
What went wrong 👌 Regardless I have Resurrection powers! They are all in heaven I run THIS PLANET EARTH 🌎 ☝️
So how can I clarify it!! How can I be at peace with this mess!! And I'm talking about the deadly ghetto streets of America 🇺🇲👌 

Your only Hope is Get Saved John 3:16/17 and tell others about Jesus! And Warn them about the enemy Kingdom we are living in! Soon His ANTICHRIST AND FALSE PROPHET LEADERSHIP REV 13 is coming to Mark all 8 billion people 666
Take you down! But many will turn to Christ 
Rev 6:9-11 and Rev 12:11 And Rev 20:4 wake up 

Hebrews 9:27
27 And as it is appointed unto men and women once to die, but after this the judgment

I will never add to the Bible God asked me to help you understand the scriptures it's an ancient book I'm writing it for the year 2026

> This vibe, this vibe made me depressed for the duration of the song and then I actually questioned my existence. How and why does it all exist 

Because it can and will. Never started with and never ended

There is no day or night, its all moving gas. 
Nothing is something, put it differently you cant picture nothing because an empty void is something

Is getting depression just finding out the truth? Is anxiety getting scared of the true being of existence and why its GOT TO HAPPEN?!

WHY?!
the hardest question to ever answer, unanswered wellbeing its thought.

I'm going insane, or am I just figuring it out

Of course I'm no body, no body who studies the truth. But this all matters 
Or it doesn't 
We are all something
Or we are all nothing 
But nothing doesn't exist, neither doesn't non existent because EVERYTHING exists
We all came from a water molecule 
And now
That molecule molecule is the ocean

Of course no one will find this, ever, but it exists and hello. You will not meet this ever again. Part now thereby thou learns truth, don't be confused just believe...

All we can do is believe because if the universe is forever expanding so quickly... then where and what is it expanding into... and how do we know that 

Hell everything we see in the stars, depending distance, is happening years ago. So is life just get on and live with it
I CANT LIVE WITH IT

I want to but can't learn more for we we all will go soon. 
What if Planet Earth is the only planet with society, or even intelligent dominant species, or even animals, or  even mammals, or even plants, or even molecular sized life signs
Or life

It hurts

Stop

Why
Why do we have to live without knowing
We all think we are leaving tye truth but the truth must exist without existing? It exists but is impossible to tell. NO ONE KNOWS 


And that's the magic, hell, of life

> @Zach Dickey  thank you for your kind words. We haven't spoken to eachother for a while he sleeps on the couch. He doesn't even speak to our daughter. He packed all his things from the bedroom. I go to school full time. He never asks me how I'm doing, what classes I'm even taking. Even my daughter knows more than him. I work as a delivery driver he's been jobless for 2 years he had a job briefly for 2 months. I been providing since March and still have to cook, clean, take care of our daughter, take her to school and go to my internship. I been paying for all our bills so he could focus on getting his CDL. At times it seemed like he just got used to me taking care of all the bills. He would wake up late like 3 and then play on the ps4. And miss all the calls from the cdl schools. He wouldn't even clean up after himself and I'd ask him to if it was the least he could do. He got mad at me before Thanksgiving when I asked if he could wash the dishes better and not just rinse them. He broke the TV. When I paid November rent I told him I was so stressed with everything I had going on and I wasn't going to be able to pay December rent. And then December came I had about 100 dollars and he asked for the rent when he had just gotten the tax refund and I just assumed he was going to use that as rent. So with finals going I literally had to work delivery driver days and nights every day and I'm still working that so I can pay rent and bills next month. And I'm so upset that my daughter is suffering through this. I'm so upset at myself that I can't afford any presents this year. What sucks is that when I was done with my internship I was offered a permanent position. And I couldn't even share the good news....

> That's such a good yet heartbreaking feeling isn't it. I had a girl I secretly admired in high school, she was 3 years younger but so together and mature. I graduated and moved to Florida and during a trip back home 2 years later I was at my parent's house and she calls me out of the blue and asks me to come over. I'm in a state of disbelief but eagerly go over. I go over to her parent's house and Marty, her brother answers the door. Me and Marty aren't besties but we had some dealings together. He calls Melissa up and when i see her happiness invades me like nothing before. I can't explain it. We go to her room and talk. She said marty told her i was up from Florida. She said she gathered the nerve to call me so she could tell me to come save her from her family pressure of being perfect. She said she knew I liked her from all my flirting in high school but I was too old then. We talked and before I left she said her and John were going to the prom as friends and after that she would love to come see me in Florida. I knew john from baseball and he was a good dude. Anyway before I left we had one long, soft passionate kiss, I still can feel her lips, the softest ever. I left so happy. Two weeks later my mom calls and says to me,"Sammy, Melissa and John died driving home from the after prom. They're saying John was drunk and ran off the road and hit a tree head on. John died instantly and Melissa a week later." I wanted to kill John again but he just did what everyone else did. Needless to say I never got to have Melissa come to Florida but her memory will live in my heart forever. I almost broke down writing this

我願意為了妳放棄一切

'Cause I know that you feel me somehow

因為我知道在妳心中也有我的一席之地

You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be

妳的存在使我如身處於天堂般

And I don't wanna go home right now

而我還不想孤身返家

 

And all I can taste is this moment

我想好好品嚐與妳的每一片刻

And all I can breathe is your life

我的生命全歸屬於妳

When sooner or later it's over

儘管這一切遲早會消失殆盡

I just don't wanna miss you tonight

我仍想任性的與妳多待一會

 

And I don't want the world to see me

我不奢望世界能看見真實的我

'Cause I don't think that they'd understand

畢竟他們也不會懂

When everything's meant to be broken

在這萬物註定消亡的世界中

I just want you to know who I am

我只想讓妳一人瞭解並看透我

 

And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming

別再為了不必多愁的事掉淚

Or the moment of truth in your lies

或是那些暗藏在謊言背後的真心

When everything feels like the movies

當一切都有如電影般不真實

Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive

妳只能透過傷害自己來確認這不是場騙局

 

And I don't want the world to see me

我不奢望世界能看見真實的我

'Cause I don't think that they'd understand

畢竟他們也不會懂

> Each of us is the stuff of stardust. This is an actual scientific fact.

We are made of stardust. The real stuff.

So each of us is inherently endowed with some special power. That is also a fact.

If you doubt it, watch the effect the least among us can have on the most powerful. People with awful deformities and diseases and hardships can bring kings to their knees in a flood of tears.

I've taught prisoners who did terrible things I didn't want to hear about. But many of them told me about their crimes. I was never there to judge them and no person should be defined by his worst or best moment.

But all us have the potential to be part of something great, or to make a difference. Some of us must struggle for years to feel like we made a difference. Some don't live that many years but become great by doing the right thing in a crucial moment.

Life is strange. But your life matters.

“Everybody can be great … because anybody can serve. You don’t have to have a college degree to serve. You don’t have to make your subject and verb agree to serve. You only need a heart full of grace. A soul generated by love.”

>  @ethanyoung3235  Souls like yours, souls that have suffered immensely, are often the ones that learn and grow to such an extent that they become further awakened, profondly realizing and understanding who they are and what their life purpose is. Personal and spiritual growth can happen volontarily, but tragedies like these are what reinvent individuals and also often inspires an entirely different mindset and perception of the world. And it is only then when you realize how your life was meant to be lived that you can accomplish extraordinary things, for yourself and all of those around you. Ethan, I admire your strength, your courage, and your determination. You are a pure and beautiful soul, an exceptionally strong soul. I want you to know this, the moment you will meet her again will be the moment where you will truly, completely and entirely understand how every single thing happens for a reason, there you will only experience and feel unconditional love. Love is all that matters. 
I wish you only the best and for you to live a life full of love and happiness.

> I mean its quite simple and not really in the good way. The chorus is literally the same melody as the verse but in a different octave. Thats pretty lazy composition. and the melody itself is extremely predictable and doesnt change at all except for the bridge, however the bridge melody is still extremely predictable. The harmony is good, but the best part about the harmony is more the different instruments timbers together rather than the combination of the notes themselves however that is still good. Theres nothing really wrong with the song, but nothing really great either. I would say its mid. The most creative thing they did in this song was use orchestral string instruments like a cello, but even then thats pretty common in this emo genre.

Edit: I changed my mind. There actually is something pretty bad about this song. Lyrics are extremely on the nose emo. Typical uncreative emo whiny lyrics. If you are going to complain about something in your lyrics try not to make it sound annoyingly whiny and cringe even if it is in the emo genre.

> LYRICS:

And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't want to go home right now

And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
And sooner or later, it's over
I just don't wanna miss you tonight

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah, you bleed just to know, you're alive

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am

> wild you said that. my sister was born in 2002 and i was trying  to explain to her today how she missed it- and that the 90s were so sick- trult an amazing time in which human society reached it’s actual peak.. even tho i was a baby/little kid, i think back witth such nostalgia,and just smile gratefully that i was able to see/experience it. (born 93)like “listen i know i sound crazy-but it was so much better-the colors were different.. stuff is literally all gray now or stucco color- modern buildings are soulless- (i kid you not i said this) THE SUN SHINED A DIFFERENT SHADE.”

glad im not the only one who remembers this. i feel lees crazy. but man sighs - to go back once- even if only for a day- id give alot just to go back for a bit/ drive to the nearest kickback- hide my iphone as to not scare anyone. buy a bunch of apple and amazon stock… like $109grand a piece.. (factoring in my realtime savings numbers lol)

and just enjoy the vibes of a time passed… 

cheers

> I'm commenting this on January 31 2025 and I wholeheartedly agree! with this comment!!! 
WTF happened to music over the last decade?!??!? It's like as a whole people's attention span and taste in music somehow acquired ADHD to the 10th power of Disorder!!!  I'll admit I had some idea who the Goo Goo dolls were back then but Iris and the City of Angels movie made me a fan of the Goo Goo Dolls!  

Side note: As a published R&B/HipHop music "producer/ songwriter/composer" I've tried several times to sample Iris and could never get it to the proper respect it deserved as a song of its magnitude in a "re-defined" form.  Now maybe that a detriment to my abilities as a "music producer/composer" OR maybe that an acumen to how iconic the song is that I, myself appreciate it so much in its natural form that I couldn't dismantle it for "something different"???? But I'll keep trying, and if I ever get there I can only hope those of you interested will approve.

> This was "THE SONG" in the summer of 1998!  I mean it was huge!  Every radio station, no matter what genre, had it on the playlist.  I was 16 and spent my summer days working at a hardware store and my spent my summer nights cruising around in cars with my friends blasting the radio as loud as we could.  On days off from the store, my friends and I fished.  The late '90s were a great, prosperous, positive time in America and it was a great time to be a teenager.  At the end of that summer I met my first real girlfriend at the Starbucks of a Barnes & Noble bookstore.  She'd spend the next few years loving me and then ripping my heart out, but whenever I hear this song I think of her and those days.  I remember holding her close as we slow danced to it at my Homecoming Dance in 1998.  She was beautiful, but very dangerous!  That's the way life goes.  High five to the Goo Goo Dolls for making a song that has withstood the test of time!

>  @ajl2232  Each generation has their own favorites, mine was the 70's and 80's, but I still enjoy some of the 90's. I'm 63 years old, grew up on old Country but I branched out to enjoy all music forms (rock,country, heavy metal, even rap and hip hop) Each generation thinks their music is "best" and it may be....for your generation, but please (and I know you haven't but...) please never put down an older generations music like many on here have. Music touches the soul and when a person puts down another's music stating theirs is better, then it's not only an insult to that person's music but their soul as well. I'm not insulted by what you've said but many others have totally trashed the 70's and 80's as "old school". You'll understand when the younger generation starts to down your generational music. Remember music touches the soul (yours as well) and be respectful. Just sayin'.

> People in this reply section hating on modern music sound dumb asl. For one, the people comparing a 1998 pop song to modern mainstream rap just don’t make sense at all. And even so, there are plenty of modern rap songs with just as much or even more meaning than this song. Meaningful rap still exists and is made in its purest form, and it’s not hard to find. 

But for the people saying music like this isn’t around anymore, y’all just don’t make an effort to search for it. Here are some bands/artists: Parachute, The Script, Clinton Cane, James Arthur, James TW, Lukas Graham, Why Don’t We, Jacob Lee, Etham, Jeremy Zucker, Jess Benko, Rosie Darling, Delacey, and a whole plethora more. 

Soulful, meaningful, and real authentic music is still out there. If any of y’all saying music isn’t good anymore took the time to look for it you would’ve found it by now.

> Я вічність віддав би за дотик єдиний,
Бо знаю — ти чуєш мене крізь світи.
Ти небо моє, моя вища вершина,
І зараз додому не хочу я йти.

Я мить цю на смак відчуваю щосили,
Дихаю тільки життям я твоїм.
Коли все закінчиться — скоро чи пізно, —
Не хочу прощатись під небом німим.

Не хочу, щоб світ мене бачив,
Бо він не збагне моїх ран.
Коли все приречене зникнуть,
Хай знаєш ти — хто я є сам.

Не стримати сліз, що не хочуть литися,
В брехні твоїй — істини сплеск вогняний.
Коли все навколо — як кадр із кіно,
Ти кров проливаєш, щоб знати: живий.

Не хочу, щоб світ мене бачив,
Бо він не збагне моїх ран.
Коли все приречене зникнуть,
Хай знаєш ти — хто я є сам.

Не хочу, щоб світ мене бачив,

POR ESO NO VA CONFIAR EN NINGUN MLP 
SOLO A SU MADRE QUERIDA QUE CUANDO LA VIÓ LE DIJO:

LA VOY A ROMPER, LO VOY A LOGRAR. 
Y DE LOS MIOS NO ME VOY A OLVIDAR,

Y PA LOS QUE SE QUEDAN ABRAZO TERRENAL.

> Es tiempo de abrir los ojos, apartarse del pecado y CONOCER a Dios. Es tiempo de dejar tanta tontería y vicio. JESÚS entregó su vida por amor a ti; para limpiarte, para hacerte libre y darte vida ETERNA junto a Él. Sufrió por tu pecado el dolor y castigo que tú merecías en una cruz. Al tercer día resucitó y vuelve pronto a juzgar la Tierra. Está avisando. Por eso... ARREPIÉNTETE y conócelo antes que sea demasiado tarde, para que no tengas que pasar el resto de la eternidad atormentado en la más profunda y oscura soledad. Porque Dios odia el pecado. Y no olvides que la muerte puede visitarte por sorpresa. 
EL FIN ESTÁ CERCA.

> La plena de Beele me transporta a ese instante mágico donde una sola mirada es capaz de enamorar. Es impresionante cómo la canción captura esa emoción pura, esa atracción que nace desde lo más profundo del ser. Cada verso es como un suspiro, reflejando la forma en que nos cautiva alguien no solo por su físico, sino por su esencia y manera de ser. Es un recordatorio de que el amor va más allá de lo visible; está en los gestos, las miradas, en todo lo que no se dice pero se siente.🔥🔥

**Artists:** Kendrick Lamar, SZA

### 1. @astriul2746 (2586 chars)

> [Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you

[Chorus: SZA]
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
Motherfucker, I don't even like you
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
On my momma, that's the realest shit
 

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you

[Chorus: SZA]
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

[Verse 2: SZA]
Skin covered in ego
Get to talkin' like a end-forth, like a rebound
No control, no off switch
In the way that you bringin' me down
It's a turn on, get it away from me
Know you mean wrong, keep away from me
And it's all wrong, get it away from me, yeah
I just cry for no reason
I just pray for no reason
I just thank for the life, for the day
For the hours and another life breathin'
How did it all go to feel good?
You could live it all if you feel bad
Better live your life
We were runnin' out of time
 

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & SZA]
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you

[Chorus: SZA]
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know

Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you

[Chorus: SZA]
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
Motherfucker, I don't even like you
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
On my momma, that's the realest shit

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?

This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

[Verse 2: SZA]
Skin covered with ego
Get to talkin' like a end-forth, like a rebound
No control, no off switch
In the way that you bringin' me down
It's a turn on, get it away from me
Know you mean wrong, keep away from me
And it's all wrong, get it away from me, yeah
I just cry for no reason
I just pray for no reason
I just thank for the life, for the day
For the hours and another life breathin'
How did it all go to feel good?
You could live it all if you feel bad
Better live your life
We were runnin' out of time

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & SZA]

Oh, you important? You the moral to the story, you endorsing?
Motherf-, I don't even like you
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage, who I'm building with
I want the credit if I'm losing, or I'm winning
On my momma, that's the realest sh-
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (haunt)
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you
All the stars approach you
All the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
Skin covered in ego
Get to talkin', I get involved
Like a rebound, got no end game
Got no ways out, got to stay down
It's the way that you making me feel
Like nobody ever loved me like you do, you do
You kinda feel like you're tryna get away from me
If you do, I won't move
I ain't just cry for no reason (reason)
I ain't just pray for no reason (reason)
I give thanks for the days, for the hours
And another way, another life breathing
I did it all 'cause it feel good
I wouldn't do it at all if it feel bad
Better live your life
We were running out of time
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (haunt)
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you
All the stars approach you
All the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer

Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you

This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize you far as confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
Motherfucker, I don't even like you
Corrupted man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
On my momma, that's the realest shit

Love, let's talk about love is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you

This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

Skin covered with ego
Get to talkin' like a end-forth, like a rebound
No control, no off switch
In the way that you bringin' me down
It's a turn on, get it away from me
Know you mean wrong, keep away from me
And it's all wrong, get it away from me, yeah
I just cry for no reason
I just pray for no reason
I just thank for the life, for the day
For the hours and another life breathin'
How did it all go to feel good?
You could live it all if you feel bad
Better live your life
We were runnin' out of time 

Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you


This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

         Your welcome ☺

> HaloWarsFireteam if your saying argument of race is irrelevant then your completely tone deaf to the whole  issue of what black as a WHOLE go through. Sure some not all of us live up to the arrogant stereotypes that are labeled on us just like any other race. And I don't wanna say or people suffer the most cause it shouldn't be a competition on who suffers the most. But our people point blank do suffer , so when something as great as a movie like this is heavy influenced and showing black culture, you damn right we gonna show as much love as possible.

In Latin Culture, African Latino created Salsa, Samba, Bachata, Samba, Reagotone.. etc.   Justin Bieber, BRITNEY SPEARS, Justin Timberlake , Fergie, Lady Gaga, music are produced, written by Black American Artist.

> K K I’ve heard bits about the ‘all the stars are closer’ parts relate to the closing shot of the movie. Where the kid looks up to T’Challa and asks who he is, and it’s like seeing a heroic figure who looks like you and your dreams of becoming like him is that close, just like the stars are closer to you than you know. Every kid’s dream of looking for someone he could look up to, especially ones who he can physically relate to.

This song takes me back to a time when the world wasn't in as shitty a state as it is now, I was still living with my folks, happy in my first job (before I realised how toxic it was, but that's hindsight!), was in a new relationship (it didn't last, but I was happy at the time!), so yeah, maybe this song just takes me back to a time where I was more naïve, but I was definitely happier than I am now.

> You described this feeling so great, i feel the same sometimes (even a lot) like you would want to start cry without reason  thinking that everything is going bad, the worst in this is that being not suicidal sometimes makes me think that there is no problem and its all fake  but there is right? Also feeling lonely while being in group i eh can,t describe it really like everyone ignored your presence sometimes but still being friendly sometimes everyone is  meeting with others (asking them  to hang out while we are all talking )  but when its time to ask if im going ,  it never happens, there is always reason why im not invited or they didn't gone at all. Also im the person asking if i can go which i think i shouldn't do but yet i still do in hope to remind of my existence cause maybe they just forgot how sad it is to hear about meeting and everything  but never hour or place. I guess im paranoid a lot? I hope that without reason, but i have some reasons to be, sad stories which doesn't really matter and yet make me  feel like its my fault or not only some friends  fail.  I took every joke personally even if its not really visible, im just too afraid of being laught off or that its gonna be idk placed to me for next years. i don't know what to do to feel better, i want to meet other people , friends but I don't know how, and i want to meet them irl not online, but going outside lonely which i do makes me feel sad when i see group of people laughing and having fun. I wonder if im so fucked up that no one will ever like me but then i remind myself about friends that i actually kinda have and kinda don,t like if i would be so worthless piece of trash then why would people even talk about meetings while im near them  or spending time with me at all?  
What also hits me is self hate which i overcome by doing something, i have a lot of dreams which i want to do, i still feel like im an idiot but i at least do something to be  better person right? I can more but i bet no one cares and i don't really even know why im writing this  
... But why not thanks for reading if anyone did.


Edit: So i didn't mention some weird secret channel shit which started happening, the easiest way to explain it is that i had 2 groups of friends from class which didn't liked each other cause one group started making secret channels on discord, i was like negotiator but everything gone wrong and one group stopped friendship with me, then they sat on secret channel for a week and in some way apologized, now we are not close friends but there is no problem at least. Then the other group angry as me for those channels month later started to hide. Like i hoped its not because of me because it started when i was on grandparents house without computer so I couldn.t go anyway  but  Well as my paranoia and i expected the ones that didn't wanted 
to hang out with me for some reason or were hiding on secret discord channel did it because of me, which is sad but stupid honestly  from all bad things i can say about myself  I can't say im like annoying i barely talk so there is no reason to hide on secret channel but whatever , the fact that i learned the truth helped me a bit but to achieve this info i had to confront the best friend   because he was sitting on this secret channel and lied to me that they aren't and this like completely ruined mine progress of self repair for a moment i started feeling the worst kind of fears, one of them is losing this friend because of my fail . then while we talked he said that they had something to discuss about (its a lie too i think because they were sitting there way more many times or at least for next 3 days and past 2 weeks  also they were playing a game and i joined thats how i guessed , also while i asked what's the problem they discussed he didn't want to tell me which is also sad cause i thought we could tell to each other everything[ or it was a lie ] ) only them but he couldn't give me permission to view this channel so i asked the owner of server and he finally told me " did i though that i might be the reason?"  yeah its sad to hear this after 2 years ngl but i was thinking that he doesn't want me as friend, just as someone from class to help or to play game. There was one weird thing with him  but it doesn't matter so much now. anyway right now i hope that only he doesn't want me as a friend and others had another reason to sit there, or he told me this cause they have actually  some secret stuff.


Edit 3: 06.2.2021 : I lost another friend, people are starting the type of joking i was really afraid and anxious about. I'm unsure if i have any friends now....

> I fell for this boy. He is the most amazing, understanding and caring young man I have ever met. We met on internet over the summer of 2019. He’s from America and I’m from France. Never intended to fall for him at all,  it kind of just happened. For the time in my life I felt loved, and understood. He helped me go through some very hard times of my life. Nobody has ever made me feel this comfortable. He listened and supported me when I was at my lowest. We were going strong! Even with the 6 hours jet lag we still managed to talk everyday, all day. We planned so many things, obviously meeting, maybe going to college together in America, go on vacations with his family.. It seemed too good, too beautiful and great to be true. Unfortunately with Covid going on , all of our hopes of meeting fell apart. We tried everything we could but it wasn’t enough. We just couldn’t do anything but wait until COVID just gets better. Being in love with someone you can’t touch, you can’t see with your very own eyes, you can’t smell, or feel is the hardest thing EVER. It was too hard , it was hurting us too much. After a couple months of trying to keep it working we decided to break up at the end of the summer of 2020. We are still in contact, everyday we talk and FaceTime. Nothing has changed, nothing will. But we are not exclusive anymore, he is in college and can meet girls if he wants to. I can as well. But it feels like we are not ready to give up. In the bottom of our heart we are still hoping it will work out. 

Jonathan I promise I will see you soon. 

Gosh writing this made me cry so hard. But it feels good.

> There are days that are so bright ahead of you, they would blind you if you saw them now. There will also be more heartache, depression and anxiety. But you'll reach a point where you'll be able to separate a temporary feeling from a permanent block. When that happens, even the dark times will feel just as beautiful to you as the bright times. If you've never trusted anyone, trust me. I was a heroin addict for 6 years. Homeless. No family. No love. Just darkness and more darkness. I got so comfortable in the dark that I became afraid of the light. But i held on every single day by the tips of my bleeding fingers because i knew there was a reason I was still alive. Now I'm so happy and so sad, but I love every minute of all of it. I haven't touched heroin in 7 years, I rent a room from a family that basically adopted me, and I fell so madly in love for 3 years with my partner who was also my neighbor lol.. that ended in the worst heartache I've ever felt, but it taught me so much, and my days were dark again for almost a year but I knew from the past the i just had to hold on again. 2 months ago a boy just stumbled into my life and what I thought was the best love ever from before, turned out to be nothing compared to what im experiencing now. Because not only am I in love with him, but I'm in love with me. You have an army behind you. Of the broken, discarded, unloved people of this world. We are your family. Just hang on every day until your time comes because it will come.

>  @maija1163  my ex now broke up with me a couple years back and told me I'll always be her first love even tho we were together for 4 years and madly in love and we never met, as soon as I heard this song the lyrics really hit me hard and for some reason I can't even cry about it.. about anything really at all anymore maybe like a coupe.times I've been to the point where I'm dry heaving but no tears come out and then I just sit there and think staring into the distance.. it's the worst feeling in the risk to be in love or even just love someone as a best friend and you've never met in your entire life in person but then they just up and leave needing to fix themselves or anything honestly just in general like the ability to keep going is so hard... It feels like you've lost your whole purpose sometimes.. you think you found the one and then just nope, it never works out it seems towards a long term perspective.. like they had it all planned is how it feels.. like you were a lesson in someone else's life and then you don't even get to see how they're life plays out its a sad thing and makes me think I'm not worthy of someone so special.. even tho we are friends now and she said she still loves me it's the point that she is the only person that kept me going in my hardest times and then she left.. "all and then most of you, some and now none of you.. don't know what I'm supposed to do haunted by the ghost of you"

His remains, all that was left of him, we're found 5-20-17 of a likely overdose, although we will never know for sure what happened. This song reduces me to tears in seconds. I close my eyes listening to this picturing our life together like a flipbook of memories replaying over and over again. The lyrics of this song are quite literally the most heart wrenching, heartbreaking words ever made into a song imo. I'll never love another person again. 34 yrs old and I KNOW I'll never be with another man again and it's by choice. Noone could ever come close to the bar that man set. And it wouldn't be fair to try to be with someone else knowing I'll never feel for them what I felt for him. I'll love him from now till the next life when our souls find each other again. 

I'm so sorry for ur loss. This isn't a pain that words can easily describe nor is it one easily defined by what someone else feels in their grief. But I feel like u may be the first person who put into words exactly what this song means to me and how deeply my grief is hitting. I hope one day both of us can heal from this unimaginable grief. Sending u so many virtual hugs. They will be with us forever, I have to believe that. 

I love u forever Robert Brian, to infinity & beyond my love. 💔❤️

> I'm so sorry for y'all's loss. My heart goes out to you all. That quote is the perfect quote to explain trying to do your best for a loved one with depression. In my case, that's from someone who has struggled with depression but luckily hasn't been genuinely suicidal and somehow got myself out of it for the most part (professional help does help & actually trying your best to listen to how your loved ones do care for you with the  things they do try to do, that's the only way I can explain how because otherwise I'm just as perplexed how I no longer feel that way as much---so for those suffering, know that it IS possible even when it doesn't seem like it is; I remember thinking that too and now there's times when I can't remember how it feels to be completely depressed and that's a glorious place to keep living for because it WILL happen if you keep working towards it). I highly recommend anyone struggling with depression and anxiety to get your health checked because I turned out to have an autoimmune disease that had those as symptoms and tending to my disease probably was a huge part in healing and getting to a more peaceful point too. PLEASE just keep going and fighting!!

Also: Crocodile Tears, really?! Why joke on a comment that is obviously referring to such a tough subject for others? Please learn the place and time. And why even bring a political slur into it at all?

> No, I don’t….She only wanted me to be with her and only her. She was toxic when I wanted to spend time with my family/friends. She despised my family and my friends, even though they were nice to her.

I couldn’t move forward as a person because of her. I broke it off, and she isn’t in my life anymore. After all the pain, she asked me if we could still be friends. I’ve never said no that fast before. 

This song reminds me not of her, but the pain I’ve went through. I was depressed because my previous attempts to be in a relationship failed. I’ve only been used, girls treated me like crap and they just played with my heart, just like my ex. She left me scarred, and I was afraid to go to a new relationship. 

My new girlfriend is, however, better than the girl I’ve had before. I love my current girlfriend more than anything. She is my world and she made my life less miserable and gloomy. I don’t want to lose her, because if I will, I would just give up trying to find someone new. Hope she won’t leave me, because I sure as hell won’t. Please wish me luck as I do not want to be lonely in this messed up world. May God help me and all of you who took the time to read this.

Update: well, the last part of this comment didn’t age that well. We broke up like 3-4 weeks ago. I am with no one, heartbroken and gave up on girls for now

> I am so sorry.  My husband took his life in front of my daughter and I almost four years ago.  I feel for you. 

Daniel, it doesn’t get easy or hurt less. But what I can PROMISE you is that there will be a day you finally smile again, smile without feeling guilty, there is a day you can find some peace in the pieces that made up the moment he didn’t survive and all the moments that followed that have been left behind for you to clean.  There does come a day you have peace with the pieces. I think that might only make real sense to another survivor.  

It may not hurt less, but we grow stronger.  You’ve been tasked with this incredible burden, to carry from every day forward.  It is crushing in the beginning, there are days you teach full fatigue and just want to put it down and can’t. But what happens as we carry weights in a physical sense? Each day that goes by our muscles rip and tear and rebuild under the weight. You become strong enough to carry it. You will become strong enough to carry it without the knowledge of that weight continuing to be all consuming. There is a day coming where you will carry your burden but be strong enough to focus on your daily life. That day is coming.  May your love be at peace.  May you be at peace.  One survivor to another you will find life and laughter again ❤️❤️🙏🏼

> Oh hun, I stumbled on your comment and my heart breaks for you. Losing a love/soul mate is one thing, as is losing a child but enduring the loss of both...I have no words. It's times such as these that I do believe a higher power must intervene because the strength it takes to make it through one day is...incredible. So don't ever doubt your strength because you are one of the very few who are handling such situations. You will preserve dear, I promise you. Please keep on keeping on. You got this. My thoughts and prayers are with you. 

And I cannot believe some of you said "You'll be alright..." Really?? You type that as your sitting with your spouse and/or children. Wtf is wrong with you? People who say such things have never endured true loss. Because if you did you would know the last true piece of the puzzle is that 'it's going to be okay.'.. because it isn't. Things alter, evolve and morph...but what once was... still exists and always will. It can haunt the hell outta you if you don't pick and choose your battles. But these such individuals would know nothing about such war. And in my humble opinion- if you've never felt it, been there, experienced it, you're not allowed to speak about it as if you have because I promise you...nothing will ever come close. smh.

>  @janellaarnedo9457  HEY THERE
I CANT IMAGINE WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH 🥺❤❤
you're strong, fucking strong to let go of people, which is not an easy trait
you're independent, and own up to your mistakes and try your best to correct yourself
it took me 4-5 years to realise that no one knows whats best for us, than ourselves
yes, attention may sound good, but at a point we feel supressed..being alone with our thoughts, talking to ourselves is a sign that shows self-love, cause you are the only person who wont judge yourself.

maybe you started pushing away people, cause you realised you're better off without them, or maybe you had no intentions, and it was just a reflex.
no matter what that is, you always move one step forward with every mistake you make
every one of us has that one person who'll love us unconditionally, maybe not our parents, maybe not our own family
it might as well be a random stranger u found on the internert
(ignore my typos, im breaking down cause of what ur going through :( )
i love you stranger, and i always will remember this.
i hope we talk again ( insta: vaibooooo)
you're precious.and you deserve all the happiness in the world <333
maybe what u want is pampering, or just time alone to focus on urself, anything it is, let me know :)
keep going!

> ​ @kathymateer  I think you should first try to discuss this with a closer circle than youtube comment section, as they will be more aware and informed on the situation than random internet-goers. I would ask the people involved and your daughter most of all how they feel. But its should go without saying that you as a person are indebted to no one, no matter who is paying for what or how long you knew one another. 

If your ex tries to hang the fact that he is helping to finance the event over anyone's head and tries to make the wedding about him not the union of your daughter and soon to be son in law then you have to ask yourself what it is you value more; a nice paid for wedding ceremony, or a memory you won't look back on with bitterness.

Once again, I would get the opinions of you and your family and those related (most importantly your daughters and her fiance!) And btw, this isn't 'his' song, even if you right now associate it with him. To me, it was the song that my coach played during football practice in high school and is involved in so many of my fondest memories. This song doesn't belong to your ex-husband, and neither does your daughter's wedding.

I wish you the best of luck and will pray for you. I hope things end with a happy memory :)

> Actually when i hear this song i remember the only one girl i truly fell in love. I had been through so many love disappointments that is why i was afraid to take initiative, we were friends in high school. Even today I have fears, but I was in love with her, and she have a boyfriend for 4 years, one day she broke up and I was the first to be informed of the breakup by herself. I thought that only I had unrequited emotions in this relationship until we graduated and never saw each other again, and when I went to open the graduation album I came across the signs that they were matched, I didn't notice, but she was Beside me in all the photos, she wanted to appear in all, very close to me, and wanting to be with me. Well ... Then she said she had feelings for me, but it was already too far from where we lived, and she was already in another relationship. This song makes me sad because, i want to go back in time, in the prom's night, and tell to myself kiss her, and tell her i love her. It's too late, it's like this sentence:
"There are three things in life that never go back: the thrown arrow, the spoken word, and the missed opportunity"

> pls keep fighting i dont mean to be that person but theres a void in us only god can fill, he himself said peace itself comes from above. i urge you for me, for you and those whose life u have made better and the ones waiting for you in the future to keep fighting. im known to help people with their problems and im grateful god gave me a gift to understand and help others. if u need anyone to talk to im right here. dont think about being a burden or something i asked u to come so thats for me to deal with and dont think your pain isnt as big as someone else; a scrape and a stab wound are both different but they're both wounds that if u leave unattended and keep to yourself they become worse. whether your pain is a scrape or a stab wound pls dont keep it inside. god sees all and is watching; u may ask where was that god but one thing we dont realize is that he was there with his arms open waiting for us to come to him. he gave us the choice to come to him and didnt force us. i urge u to give him a chance like i did and ur tree will grow and you'll definitely enjoy the fruits u sowed.keep fighting.

> We together in this
But we gon be happy someday, together,

Cry when you have to
It means you dont like to share evil on others, like others shared it on you
Be proud of yourself
Be proud you have a good heart
Be proud you dont have a stone in there
Be proud you can bleed inthere
You gon cherish love 1000x more when youll get it, 
most of them dont feel it, they are empty
You see beauty where others dont

Your tear is worth more than their smiles
Your smile is worth more than all their money

We got you
You got us

Lord will take care of us all someday
Trust me, i give him all my tears
He gives me peace and cleanses me of deppresion
Now i can slowly help others

We gon be fine❤️
Just dont lose hope
Dont harm yourself

I know you wanna die sooooo many times

But you know damn well
That 1 happy moment... 
Little bit of Light

Weights over all those sad hours.

We gon be fine.

And i know this...
When u wanna die
Its not cuz u dont want to live... 
Its cuz you want to feel alive, and not dead inside

You want to be alive and you want to live this life.

And you will ❤️

> Hey Hammie.
Even though we can't forget the presence of those who had been our everything, losing them doesn't mean they are gone forever. They live within us, watching us smiling, crying, bleeding, and standing up to fight. They live within our very soul, something that their passing away couldn't take away. 
I am not saying, don't cry. Cry, cry as much you want, but don't forget to wipe those tears and don't lose your smile. When you feel weak, don't doubt yourself, let yourself be taken care of, let someone else lift your load. But when you are well again, don't forget that inner strength you always had. Just remember, that the ones we love will be always watching us, so if you really love them...show them you are really strong and live will with their memories. So that, when they see you, they finally have that peace which they must had lost while parting away from you. 
I hope you find the strength when you feel weak.
I hope you find your way when you are lost in the darkness.
I hope you smile once again and live your life with happiness.
May God bless you, dear Hammie.

> I'm so, terribly sorry about the loss of Tom. Losing a lover, wife, husband, boyfriend, girlfriend, etc. is very hard. The "what ifs" seem to get me and haunt me. I'm praying that you, your family, friends, Tom's family and friends all will find some kind of peace throughout this event. There isn't really a whole lot to say to someone that just lost someone in their life. What I want to say is please try to remember all the good times, all the love that was shared between you and Tom, or just the love that everyone had for Tom. You will never, ever forget about Him, and that is a kinda a double edged sword. One piece of your heart wants to forget this whole episode with Him passing away, thinking the hurt would go away with it. But another piece of your heart wants to smile all day long just thinking and revisiting some of your greatest moments with Tom. Whatever way you have chosen or choose to grieve, just know that it is totally ACCEPTABLE to grieve however you NEED to. I'm giving you "digital hugs" right now and I will continue to think about you. ❤

>  @aliviamcmurtrie4120  yes I am okay now . & thank you . What people don’t realize is that the person that wrote that comment is what helped me realize what the problem was when I reflected back on my own . To simplify, we’re never alone or the only one feeling that way . We need these outlets ( like this song ) to help connect our feelings and help each other out . We find people that has the same feeling as us and get tied to it that we remember our own situation & hopefully share what needs to be done to help each other grow. What I said was out of love ! I could of kept the information but I want everyone to grow . Not just me . The only person you should be loved by is yourself . Doing what makes you happy or feel good inside . It’s selfish to depend on someone else for love . You give other people power over you and your emotions . Your in charge ! You create your reality ! You control how you feel . Don’t let what others do change your mind . Keep your mind under control.

> I like to see it as a desire or a wanting,  wanting that warmth of person you will love or the warmth of the person in one-sided love. Wanting to feel the love consume you instead of giving it out. Also, wanting a person to come back, recently I had lost my best friend, and so that heavy feeling devours you. Of a wanting, they put so much happiness in you yet when they leave they take all of it and more with them. It's really a yes and no feeling you get me? Like you know how it feels but you don't.  Or like, you know how to describe it but at the same time, it is impossible to describe. The funny thing is it also doesn't have a name. Every name you put it like it can be loneliness or emptiness is so perfect yet so imperfect. Everyone feels it for a specific reason, heartbreak, mourn,  guilt, sadness, jealousy, etc. Everyone has a different reason to feel it yet it's the same feeling. It's just THAT feeling.

> Omg I can relate. There is another song “Someboday I use to know that sums that up too. I had the most intense beautiful love with what I thought was a soulmate kind of love. You don’t have to say words to know what the other person is feeling because you’re so intumed with each other. Things took a turn due to addiction but when we finally separated I questioned my own salinity. Asking if it was just all in my head. Where we real. How is he able to disconnect and not struggle the way I did. We are still close now. He is like family. But it took a lot for me to be ok with us not being together. I think the substance abuse made things more intense because it felt like we were the only ones going through it. Like we were the  only ones to understand the struggle. Like a trauma bond. People cope differently. I see that now. But back then it just made me feel crazy. Just know you’re not alone.

He is 20 miles from me, living with his mother at 56 years old.....I had to take one of our dogs to him last night that I could not keep because of my job and seeing him is like looking at a stranger now!!! Where did the man I love go? He died on the operating table the day before his 50th birthday when he had triple bypass open heart surgery.......yet he still lives but I felt him pull away from me the 4 years after his surgery!!! I guess it's true that type of surgery can change a person but I never thought it would change his love for me.......the pain of losing him was excruciating but now he is just someone I do not even know anymore!!!

[Intro: JENNIE]
Lock me up and throw away the key
He knows how to get the best out of me
I'm no force for the world to see
Trade my whole life just to be

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Tell nobody I control you
I broke you just to own you
They can't tell but I love you
'Cause you're loyal, baby
I love when you're submissive
You love it when I break skin
You feel pain without flinchin'
So say it

[Pre-Chorus: Lily-Rose Depp]
Give me tough love
Leave me with nothin' when I come down
My kind of love
Force me and choke me 'til I pass out

[Chorus: Lily-Rose Depp]
We don't gotta bе in love, no
I don't gotta be the onе, no
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight
We don't gotta be in love, no
I don't gotta be the one, no
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight, oh

[Verse 2: Lily-Rose Depp]
Push me down, hold me down
Spit in my mouth while you turn me out
I wanna take your light inside
Tear me down, snuff me out
Hands on my neck while you push it up
And I'm screamin' now

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
Give me tough love
Leave me with nothin' when I come down
My kind of love
Force me and choke me 'til I pass out

[Chorus: The Weeknd & Lily-Rose Depp, The Weeknd, Lily-Rose Depp]
We don't gotta be in love, no
I don't gotta be the one, no
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight (Tonight)
We don't gotta be in love, no
I don't gotta be the one, no (Oh)
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight, oh

[Bridge: JENNIE]
Lock me up and throw away the key
He knows how to get the best out of me
I'm no force for the world to see
Trade my whole life just to be
Top of the world, but I'm still not free
This is a secret that I keep
Until it's gone, I can never find peace
Waste my whole life just to be

[Chorus: All, The Weeknd, Lily-Rose Depp & JENNIE]
We don't gotta be in love, no
I don't gotta be the one, no
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight (Tonight)
We don't gotta be in love, no
I don't gotta be the one, no (Oh)
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight (Oh), oh

> ⁠​⁠​⁠ @CalliyaRuffin-ql3sh Jennie hardly had any lines in this song. She probably had less than 20 seconds of singing in this entire song, and its near the damn end.

Lily deserves the recognition and respect she's getting from this song. I had no idea she could hit those vocals, especially during the chorus.

You don't gotta look far in the comments for 'Blackpink' fans saying their only here for Jennie. That's just plain disrespectful, but its nothing new, especially with kpop. Blackpink is from YG Entertainment, and other groups are also from YG Entertainment, but that doesn't stop fans of Blackpink to shit on those groups for even remotely copying Blackpink.

Lily is on the pedestal for a reason, and a very good reason for that.

> ​​ @MwakaLumamba  don't you found any voice differences in few parts??!? That was Jennie's line. like the following:
"Lock me up and throw away the key 
He knows How to get the best out of me 
I'm no force for the world to see 
Trade My whole life just to be 
Top of the world but I'm still not free 
It's such a secret that I keep 
Until It's gone,I can never find peace 
Brace My whole life just to be".

Three years prior to her debut, five years prior to her solo debut. Now people know her as fashion brand ambassador, Coachella headliner, a part of the biggest girl group in the world, but she was always exceptional, for the past 11 years

> @cen121 naw dog. The Weeknd is closer to IceJJFish than The King of Pop. Come to think of it, he could be The Prince Regent of Saturday and Sunday, but that’s generous. Best enjoyed at time of listening when on the level of the artist at time of creating: i.e., nearly dead from a staggering, impressive combination of drugs and alcohol. But Michael? His music could stand up to academic rigor…

> I see many complaints about Jennie not singing too much, but i think her verse is the best one, it doesn't have to be a long verse, but is the part that gives the song the intensivity and dynamic it needs, and the fact that it's built different and sang in a different vocal register, that part alone is very captivating and Jennie's voice sure captured it amazingly.

> Thank you so much for sending a comment to Youtube all the way from Brazil(!!!) AND for CARING enuf to mention the Nazis who call themselves ICE..... they are vicious, insane, sadistic torturers........ who enjoy tormenting innocent people. It is a horrifying situation that is taking place all over the USA..... and the most pronounced in Minnesota (Minneapolis especially).   All over the ENTIRE state there are vans, cars, pickup trucks and SUVs driving around with gangs of heavily armed Gestapo agents wearing full face masks, carrying huge guns and cans of pepper spray. IF for ANY reason they decide to stop you in your car, or decide to grab YOU off the street waiting on a bus.... there is NOTHING you can DO!!! They will take you where ever they want, put you in a cage and hold you until THEY decide that you are not an immigrant that they can legally hold. They will not let you call your family or a lawyer, they will not give you your medicines, they will leave your car running in the middle of the street to be stolen or towed. They will take your money, your phone, your ID, EVERYTHING you have on your body..... and NO ONE is allowed to help you! They have kidnapped ANYONE....
 old people, young people, men, women AND kids under 18 ......
 KIDS who are US citizens!!! I am NOT making this up people.... I saw all of these things ON TV on the MSM news..... About 3 weeks ago tRUMP's Gestapo Nazi henchmen went to the home of a Hmong American man (age 57) and went into his house and handcuffed him and TOOK him out of his house (in front of his 5 year old grandson) wearing only boxer shorts and a pair of croc shoes!!! They threw his robe over his shoulders....... (this man had been in the shower....
 they pulled him OUT of the shower!) This man had lived in St. Paul for about 40 years, is a US citizen, had worked with the US military in Laos in the past..... AND is a friend of THE MAYOR OF ST. PAUL (The new mayor of St. Paul is a Hmong lady. You see, the citizens of St. Paul elected an immigrant (or offspring of an immigrant)  as their MAYOR! ...... You see, these people are very open minded......  St. Paul is mostly white people, but they elected the best person for the job.... anyway, it was only 12°F outside when these inhumane torturous members of Satan's army took this elderly man NAKED from his own HOME handcuffed out to their vehicle. It was ALL recorded by MANY cameras..... then they drove around with him in their vehicle for over an hour and then returned him. Their excuse for taking him was that they said he looked like TWO people they were "looking for"...... the two men they were looking for were both about 20 years younger than this man and he did not resemble them in the least..... and he did not even know either of these two men. So, you see, it is a siege!!! These Nazis have been kidnappingcompletely innocent people down in Rochester, Minnesota (about 110 miles south of Minneapolis and St. Paul)... and bringing them up to the Whipple Federal building near the Mall of America. Then after holding them for any amount of time they release them but do NOT provide them with anyway to return to Rochester! So, you see, it is a TOTAL nightmare...... if you happen to be unlucky enuf to have these goons grab you... you are treated less than human. So, thank you very, very much for thinking of us all the way from Brazil.... we appreciate that very much..... all good people must unite and stand up to these Nazis AND tRUMP!!!! (I could go on and on with multiple instances of illegal actions by the Nazis working as ICE under tRUMP's command. tRUMP hates Minnesota becuz we did NOT vote for him, plus becuz we stand up for immigrants in Minnesota. We love immigrants..... we welcome them with open arms...... it does not matter where they are from....
. refugees and people seeking asylum from oppressive regimes in their homeland. I would be that we are the most ethnically diverse state in the entire country.... I kid you not. Whenever we get a paper from a bank or a school or the government telling us something....... they print the message in about 15-20 different languages, becuz we have people here from so many different countries. And even tho' these people are from all over the world, they find homes and jobs and go to work just like everyone else here. Thank you again for caring. It is horrible to see every nite on the news people being pulled over in their cars and 6-8 men surrounding their car with guns pointed at the people in the car..... and if the people in the car don't get out fast enuf they SMASH their car windows with their guns and then drag them out and THROW them on the ground and kneel on their backs and handcuff them and drag them away!!! And NO WARRANTS!!! They say... that they DON'T need a warrant!!! It is all illegal what they do! It is identical to NAZI GERMANY under Adolf Hitler..... which is why we call DJT.... Agolf Shitler (cuz he plays golf). Many people are protesting EVERYDAY!   So much that is happening is downplayed on the news. The news stations feel they must "bow down to the king".

> Bad bunny half time set idea - the set itself is set in New York streets, buildings and such (to foreshadow later)
The set starts with something slow but also to foreshadow the ending it starts with a “shh” from this song it’s dark and then followed by a pause… about 3-4 seconds to have people think it’s going to start with nuevayol but nope.
It starts with “titi me pregunto si tengo mucha novia” and goes into that song for a bit… lights dancing the works

Then transitions to other bops until the final song… this one nuevayol

After the dancing and such stops from the previous song they are tired from getting down and sit at a little table outside of a window like at a NY cafe and look at the center of the table. In the center there’s a radio. The iconic radio static starts the camera starts to slowly zoom toward the radios in the center and then boom the moment we’re waiting for …. on plays the “Trump apology impression” (#freedomofspeech)

Idk if it’s good but to me it gave me goose bumps…. Especially with our people being mistreated of all melanated kinds. We do not choose our skin color or race so why are we being punished. We are living in the same earth so why do borders matter. No one ever owns the property or people because we all live and we all go the same 💀. We only live once and we should focus on bettering us all to prosper on this world while we’re here. Why dedicate your time to hurting others. If you’re still reading this far please be kind. Please help those around you who need it. We are all human. We might be physically different but we’re all internally similar if not the same. Spread love not hate. We are all worthy of happiness. Live and let live as long as no harm is done. Thank you for your time and I hope you have a beautiful and wonderful day/life! 🌸

>  @JoeEsser-bg6xy it's not about politics, it's about music. Take church for instance, let's go Catholic!  How many hymns are in Latin? Now how many white Americans sing these hymns yet cannot translate word for word what it says in English? Think of food menus. How many people order a food by a word or name yet don't know what that means in it's own native tongue? It's not just Spanish, Mexican, Scottish, African, Japanese- all experience exceeds language. If you bow to someone after a kindness, no word is necessary- you know what that means. Music can be the same- why must life in general be political when it's not what you eat, breathe, and flows thru your body? Keep labels to personal preferences.

I choose enjoying life. And I'm a white woman myself, so please don't go there. I'm just not blind to others and appreciate everything and everyone equally. That's my preference, my choice, my own identity which I do not expect others to have and respect anyone's decision to be otherwise. (I just don't and won't condone being picky for no reason from my end.)💜

> Bad Bunny es la suprema cumbre de la vulgaridad y la mediocridad, es una absoluta decadencia tanto artística como Ética y social, es la prueba de que como sociedad caímos bajo y perdimos los buenos valores, se denigra a la mujer y está lo aplaude, lo festeja y deja que sus hijos crezcan pensando que la mujer es solo un objeto sexual.
La gente no ve que mientras en su cd ataca al capitalismo el tiene una casa en Miami de 8.8 millones de dólares y restaurantes de lujo y quien lo dio a conocer y lo manejo fue el viceministro comunista del gobierno de Hugo Chávez 
Señores, lo que este seudo cantante lo que promueve también es el odio a occidente y la batalla cultural o marxismo cultural.
—Se mete con la fe cristiana y yo me pregunto porque no con la musulmana—
Soy latina y a mi su discurso famoso que muchos aplauden me suena a fanfarronería y político, de amor y unidad no tiene nada solo palabras vacías.
En fin , cada quien con sus ideas y sus gustos.

> I don't know Spanish BUT Benito has inspired me to LEARN how to speak Spanish....
... and I should have learned it years ago...... so here goes "Hola!!! Ke pasa?" Uno, dous, tres!!! See, it's a start. I will set a goal of learning at least 5 news words in Spanish every morning. ...
..... learning a new language is VERY GOOD FOR YOUR BRAIN PEOPLE!!! Also, I used to not be a big fan of this salsa style of music, but listening to Bad Bunny ...... It is really starting to grow on me. And, a lot of African music has a "salsa" type sound. So, you keep up the AMAZING good work Senor Bunny....... you are LOVED by people EVERYWHERE!!!! Thank you for speaking up for human rights also..... thank you for speaking up for the importance of being REAL humane human beings. I have not felt this excited about anyone or anything in a long, long time. You are the modern version of Bob Marley. ......

> I have to say...i didn't like this. I dont feel like this is a spécial or by any means a great performance. Its médiocre and Bad Bunny is far from the best latino performer, hé is a product of circumstance and the only song i like from him is DTMF. His texts are meeeh as many rappers. But ...i love latinos, i love their energy, their food, their love of life. Its true that they and the other minorities keep the USA turning along with any hard working citizen. Its also true that unfortunately there is a lot of crime asociated with these communities, facilitated then again by all the discrimination they are confronted with. Anyway ...i like the overall message.  Now ..do we need to turn the USA into a latino country? Hell nah. Its a melting pot where everyone that is a good élément has their own importance.

Me separé alos 36 y fui mamá soltera dando ejemplo finalmente an mis hijos no se queden con una pareja porque queremos la familia junta cuando no es lo mejor para los hijos. Mis hijas tienen 27, 26 y hijo 24 son felices solteros concentrados en su educación y trabajos y planeando viajes con familia y amistades.

A lot of the people I grew up with and around are Salvadoran or Honduran. We come from different backgrounds but these ARE MY PEOPLE. It hurts to see them hunted like fucking prey today. I hate america because of the people who run it but I love it so much because of the people who BUILT IT.  The halftime
Show made me so emotional and happy I keep rewatching it. There were so many poc included. It makes my heart feel full to see everyone undivided bc if it’s one thing America gon do it’s BE DIVIDED.

> ​ @trisharb Sí, un puertorriqueño puede llegar a ser presidente de Estados Unidos, pero solo si cumple con el requisito constitucional de ser “ciudadano nacido en Estados Unidos” (natural born citizen).

📌 Algunos puntos importantes:

Los puertorriqueños son ciudadanos estadounidenses de nacimiento desde 1917, gracias a la Ley Jones-Shafroth.

Como Puerto Rico es un territorio de EE. UU., una persona nacida allí sí cumple con el requisito de “nacido en Estados Unidos” para la presidencia.

El requisito es tener al menos 35 años, ser ciudadano nacido en EE. UU. y haber residido en el país por 14 años.


👉 En conclusión:
Un puertorriqueño nacido en Puerto Rico puede ser presidente de Estados Unidos si cumple la edad y la residencia.

> Mis respetos a Benito. 

Soy de los que (por decirlo de manera elegante) mantienen reservas muy serias respecto de su calidad artística, aunque tengo que reconocer una evolución importante en su último trabajo DTMF, en el cual mezcla el trap con elementos exquisitos de la música de su tierra.

Sin embargo, lo que hizo en este video es uno de las jugadas más valientes y atrevidas de la historia de la música. Publicar un video el 4 de julio, con la bandera de Puerto Rico en la frente de la Estatua de la Libertad y un audio retocado de Donald Trump disculpándose con los inmigrantes es de una audacia casi suicida. Ni John Lennon se atrevió a tanto. Con razón Trump no lo puede ver.



Ojalá haga un show memorable en el SuperBowl.

Ok que quiera destacar a los latinos en tiempos tan hostiles y rescato que le recuerde a las nuevas generaciones artistas tan grandes como no se ven hoy como el Gran Combo de Puerto Rico que SI SABIAN HACER MÚSICA pero honestamente esperaba una mejor canción o nueva versión, aunque la verdad como siempre me defraudó no se le entiende ni papá y el ritmo es lo mismo de lo mismo, no hay una sola canción de el que me logré conectar y eso que me he dado la oportunidad de oírlo más allá de criticarlo pero no me convence, pos bueno que lo disfruten aquellos que si le encuentran gracia pa gustos los colores.

> “Lose Control”
Teddy Swims

Something's got a hold of me lately
No, I don't know myself anymore
Feels like the walls are all closin' in
And the devil's knockin' at my door, whoa

Out of my mind, how many times
Did I tell you I'm no good at bein' alone?
Yeah, it's takin' a toll on me, tryin' my best to keep
From tearin' the skin off my bones, don't you know

I lose control
When you're not next to me (when you're not here with me)
I'm fallin' apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not next to me, mm-hm
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me

Problematic
Problem is I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit
Bad habits hard to break when I'm with you
Yeah, I know, I could do it on my own
But I want that real full moon black magic and it takes two
Problematic
Problem is when I'm with you, I'm an addict
And I need some relief, my skin in your teeth
Can't see the forest through the trees
Got me down on my knees, darlin' please, oh

I lose control
When you're not next to me (when you're not here with me)
I'm fallin' apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not next to me, mm-hm
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me, yeah

> I totally agree with your comment about this man's voice❣️ It's breathtaking beautiful, where, whilst listening, your skin goes from smooth to goosebumps within zero to six seconds!
I also think that, when one reads just the text, or the entire 'story', as if it were a poem, one is immediately captivated by it..❣️
Songfacts®:

"Lose Control" isn't just a song, it's a raw, emotional battle cry. Teddy Swims sings about how love turns him into a mess of emotions when he's not with his sweetheart.

From the first note, Swims dives into the deep end of love's pool. He croons about feeling like the walls are closing in and the skin is tearing off his bones. It's a bad case of lovesickness.

"Being in love can be like an addiction sometimes - always chasing the highs from the lows," Swims said of the track. "It's about losing yourself and losing control when it all starts to cave in and thinking that the only way out is through being with that person, chasing that feeling over and over again."

Funfact✓
"Lose Control" is the lead single from Swims' 2023 debut album, I've Tried Everything But Therapy (Part 1). Released June 23, 2023.
👉🏻  Now knowing what the song Lose Control is about, the title of the entire album is, in my opinion, not only brilliantly conceived, but also with a nod to How to deal with....❣️❣️

> Sounds familiar… excellent but sounds a lot like singer 1, 2, 3, 4……1000…. The voice is sick. Make the music your own, which hard cause it can sound the same no matter what with the limitations on music theory, until you reach orchestral or just have real unique and creative insight of making something new. The talent these days is at the highest level it’s ever been. The creativity to make your music something sound like something that’s new is where legends are born. No doubt this man is amazing and with the right advertising strategy can be endless, since that what everyone is focused on these days. 
I love it, but if I’m being honest. I think he has a lot more to give and I hope he dives deep into creating a new depth to this type of amazing voice, which is not new, but is always so pleasant to the ears, mind, body, soul. 
Keep pushing. Keep creating. It will come and I’ll be waiting for that album or even a single track. You have all the tools ++. My 2 cents, u will be rich either way, but you have this diversity that I think you can combine and create something so unique that will truly blow peoples mind much more than they already are. 
Much love

> I hope you’re still fighting the good fight. That’s all we can do. Fight a good fight, get fought every so
often, but as you get stronger and you get more tools and experience, you stop letting the fight get you down to your knees less and less. Sometimes you even win, sometimes it’s a tie. But living the life that you know you’re worth living and doing all the things that keep mentally nagging you to accomplish is so much more fucking rewarding and fulfilling than what any high from any drug could ever be. Just to be able to look at everything in front of
You and know that YOU did that damn thing is such an amazing feeling and the smile that you can’t stop yourself from getting is a whole other different feeling I can’t even describe. EVERYONE who lives their lives with dignity and a simple goodness deserves to have that feeling. And I pray that this simple life is with you always and that it’s the light in the day that show you the way to happiness and peace and fulfillment and love and a full life always. Just keep fighting a good fight and don’t get too scared to get back up

> Algo no me deja ni dormir
Y no me reconozco ya no
Ya no encuentro ni por donde salir
El diablo a mi puerta llamó

Y la verdad
No puedo más
No soy bueno
Para estar solo mi amor

Quiero contenerme
Intento no arrancarme
La piel que en mis huesos quedó
Porque yo

Pierdo el control
Cuando no estás aquí
Me estoy derrumbando
Y justo frente a ti

Pierdo el control
Cuando no estás aquí
Si estoy destrozado
Es por lo que hiciste en mi

Algo malo
El problema
Es que tener tu cuerpo
Es como estar drogado

Eres un mal hábito tú
Por eso pido más de tu amor
Porque necesito tu luz
Magia bajo Luna azul

Algo malo
Me volví un adicto despiadado
Necesito seguir
Devórame así

Me arrodillé frente a ti
No te alejes de mí
Baby please, oh!

Pierdo el control
Cuando no estás aquí
Me estoy derrumbando
Y justo frente a ti

Pierdo el control
Cuando no estás aquí
Si estoy destrozado
Es por lo que hiciste en mi

Pierdo el control
Cuando no estás aquí
Me estoy derrumbando
Y justo frente a ti

Pierdo el control
Cuando no estás aquí
Si estoy destrozado
Es por lo que hiciste en mi

> I am learning English and I love this music! <3. Here is my Spanish translation:
Algo se ha apoderado de mí últimamente
No, ya no me reconozco
Siento que las paredes se me cierran
Y el diablo toca a mi puerta
Fuera de mí, ¿cuántas veces
Te dije que no sirvo para estar solo?
Sí, esto me pasa factura, hago lo posible por
No arrancarme la piel de los huesos, ¿sabes?

Pierdo el control
Cuando no estás junto a mí
Me desmorono delante de ti, ¿no lo ves?
Pierdo el control
Cuando no estás junto a mí
Sí, me rompes el corazón, nena
Me dejas hecho un desastre

Problemático
El problema es que deseo tu cuerpo como un adicto, como un mal hábito
Los malos hábitos cuestan romperlos cuando estoy contigo
Sí, lo sé, podría hacerlo solo
Pero quiero esa auténtica magia negra de luna llena y eso es cosa de dos
Problemático
El problema es que contigo soy un adicto
Y necesito alivio, mi piel entre tus dientes
No puedo ver el bosque por los árboles
Me tienes de rodillas, cariño, por favor

> Be original bruh…if you can’t come up with your own idea for a comment then at least reword it a little differently then the other original comment. This world is full of too many followers or people that do what they see others do so they can blend in and go unnoticed or are just too lazy to be creative. Be original, be YOU, there’s only one YOU out here so don’t be afraid to wholeheartedly be yourself….everyone has something different or special to offer the world but people just follow and do/say the same as others. Now I know copying a comment isn’t that deep for all this to be said about one comment and it doesn’t mean that you aren’t yourself and maybe you didn’t even see the original comment 😂😂😂. I just felt like I needed to say this to whoever needed to hear it.

> At 70 i have heard countless past and present RB sounds by black music artists didn't win but should have won Grammys in music and also in Movie Awards and black women's beauty should have received some of those Beauty Pageants Crowns. But the reality is these white controlled events, past and present are like almost everything in Racist America, in my belief and opinion only, still bias, flawed and corrupted by white racists from within, just like the Music Hall of Fame, NFL Hall of Fame, NBA Hall of Fame, Baseball Hall of Fame, Hockey Hall of Fame and etc. By the way, he will probably get his flowers, he's white sounding white country, but besides being white singing, i see nothing so special about him or his songs that stands out from the usual.😮😢

> I thought this song was about relationships (apparently I’m naive 😅), but I can say what thoughts saved me during my youth when friends tried to suggest I give it a try! I always feared losing control! I mean, my mind would be somewhere in dreams, while my body would be like an abandoned car, without a driver. And why just dream about something when you can live and actually experience everything that can appear in dreams? There’s nothing, even the most incredible things, that I couldn’t experience in reality. The main thing is not to give in to your laziness and the desire to have everything here and now without making any effort. And also, life is too short to spend part of it on a questionable pink bubble that is also harmful to health.

(I'm only going into detail about The Living End because this band deserves more attention in other countries; they might be kind of "old" now? But, still. I mean come on, it's a trio WITH A STAND UP BASS PLAYER!?!)

The content and subject of his songs are not my cup of tea. "Lose Control" is a catchy melody that is an ode to co-dependency, and essentially, so is "The Door". The story arc portrays putting a partner on a pedestal, giving them the power they were never meant to have (bec this is NOT love). Love is absent, possession & obsession are present. Sad, dramatic, & turbulent relationships, filled with anger, pain, & revenge, these are guaranteed to make for juicy songwriting!

> Good Luck, Babe but make it college!Byler

It's fine, it's cool
You can say that we had nothing, but you know the truth
And guess I'm the fool
With his arms out like a lover while you act aloof

I don't wanna call it off
But you don't wanna call it love
You only wanna be the one that I call tipsy

You can kiss a hundred girls in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling
You can say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse, 'nother stupid reason
Good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
Well, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
It’s like you’re in a trance, can’t you stop retreating
Good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
Well, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
My friend, you’re still my heart, this is so defeating

I'm cliché, who cares?
A subtextually explicit kind of love affair
And I cry, it's not fair
I just need a little lovin', but your head is full of air

Really wanna call it off
But I can’t erase my love
Why can’t you just be the one who calls me "baby"

You can kiss a hundred girls in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling
You can say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse, 'nother stupid reason
Good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
Well, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
It’s like you’re in a trance, can’t you stop retreating
Good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
Well, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
My friend, you’re still my heart, this is so defeating

Ah, ah-yeah, oh
When you wake up by yourself in the middle of the night
With your head in your hands, wanting more from your life
And when you think about me all of those years ago
My voice shaking and cold through the radio
You're hearing “should I stay or should I go”
Always “should I stay, or should I go”

You can kiss a hundred girls in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling (Should I stay or go)
You can say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse, 'nother stupid reason
Good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
Well, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
It’s like you’re in a trance, can’t you stop retreating
Good luck, babe (Well, good luck)

And when you think about me, all of those years ago
You're standing face to face with "I told you so"
You know I hate to say, "I told you so"
You know I hate to say, but, I told you so
You can kiss a hundred boys in bars

> The line about being nothing more than his wife, you made me realize something about my current relationship, and how this isn’t what I want. I realized how badly I’ve been allowing comphet to mess with my mind, and that I should just do what I want, if happiness is what I want, then I shouldn’t let people thinking that a girl liking, or rather loving another girl is wrong ruin that. I love girls, I want to kiss girls, I want to be with girls, and I want to spend my whole life with a girl. I’m a lesbian ☺️❤

edit: AAAA thank you so much for the support!! i appreciate it!!! i was able to get out of my relationship however my ex didn’t react too well to it, and sadly he bothered me for days until finally accepting it today. 😓😓 But, I’m glad that’s over with, hopefully everything goes well for him, because things have been going well for me now ❤❤ many reconnections after officially coming out and I’m so happy about it!! I did not realize how badly the relationship was affecting me until after. haha 😆 it’s all looking fine now though, hope this peace continues, and i hope anyone else in my situation also finds their escape and peace soon 💗💗💗 Happy Pride!! 🎉🌈

Edit ; Um so?… A lot happened, turns out my relationship with that guy was not the greatest, and as I was being forced into doing and saying things against my will, i wont disclose too much about it, but the relationship with my ex was just not good at all for either of us. On a more positive note, I have a girlfriend now :) I adore her, she’s my sun.  My universe, my savior, my everything really. Her warmth and light pulls me in every time and I just never want to leave her arms. She’s so kind and dear to me I never know what to do with myself. I love her a lot. ☺️ I’m wishing the best for her and I, and any others who were once in my position or are in it now. Please be true to yourself, we only live once, don’t live it for someone else.

> @pridetherapy  thank you. I just wish people understood the damage that they do, even parents that are "well intending" which I know sounds weird-- like for example, a friend of mine had very religious parents and during his teen years that sent him to a camp for his homosexuality. And he said it actually was a very nice place and the people there were very kind, no one was yelling or saying scary and hateful things or trying to "pray the gay away". But, it also was trying to de-gay them in a much more subtle way. And that still had an effect on him for awhile. And I truly do believe his parents were acting out of love. For one, they didn't even force the camp.or therapy, they just offered it and my friend took it, which makes sense as it can be such a confusing time and he wanted some answers and a chance to explore and talk to people. 

But, in the case of my guy, he was raised in an atmosphere of open and intense hatred for gays (think Westboro Baptist Church level) and so it was inescapable once it was so deeply planted and intertwined with his entire psyche. I remember how he would have really strong reactions to certain music sometimes. And I know this sounds random, but it just speaks to how insidious his parents beliefs were. Because, he would get so angry when a Lady Gaga song came on the radio and he would shut it off. And I asked him, why does she make you so upset? Like, do you just really hate her music? And he said, no I'm not angry because I hate her music, I'm angry because I like it. I tried explaining to him that anyone can like good pop music and that there are tons of straight guys that like Gaga, or beyonce, or Britney, or whatever. But, he just couldn't bring himself to enjoy things that brought him joy, because they signified how gay he was and how wrong he was. Sorry for the rant lol. That's all to say I completely agree with you.

> Ms Roan has such an exquisite talent to express the emotions in a direct way. I am a 55 year old man and this is not usually what I listen to, but I am drawn to it probably because this situation is something I had come understand recently. A dear friend of mine, whom I have met for more than twenty years is getting married in september and I wish happiness for him, but also how many more failed marriages does he need to have to realize that he is in love with me? 
Signs of affection are obvious, he always took a lot of time to spend with me (even when we didn't live toghether), he looks at me in a loving way. And I did things for him that I wouldn't do for anyone else. 
I have met him for twenty years, we've been through so much. We lived toghether, caught up in messy situations and came out alive. His eyes don't lie, nor his body language, he's been in love with me for a long time and so I am. I don't see a reason why he would not see how evident I am in my undeniable attraction to him (though he always had a problem to see something very obvious).
As these song says, i am cutting it off even if he calls it love. I am moving out of town to spend my retirement peaceful.

Ms Roan, you have great talent and I Hope your career is  full of Success, congratulations on a wonderful song.

Update on the 3rd of July at 23:36: I did it. I told him how I feel.

Update 4th of september: Well, I've moved out of the city with an old friend of mine (whom the people of our town confuse as my mother). And I was doing good, I've got an interest into beekeeping lately and that's been occupying my mind. My friend was supposed to marry this month but the engagement was called off. I am torn between calling him to lend a hand or give him support and leaving him alone (It wouldn't be the first time I dissapear for a long period of time)

> The person who made this comment won't need to see arguments in the replies. Even if it's tempting to shut down rude people, just leave it. 

All I can say about this is that from experience, it ends badly. And I think somebody has to decide if they are OK with or happy to be with somebody of the same sex while in a neutral emotional state. The passion of the early days often makes people feel like they can face anything and that they don't care what society expects of them. It's sad to say but that magic you probably both feel often calms down and what remains are the deeper and more reliable feelings which determine what your bond is really made of. 

Personally if I were ever to find myself in a situation like that again, I'd let it go. I think if what they felt was strong enough, then when given time to process what they want in life, there's a chance they'd come back to you. 

The only advice I could possibly give is to avoid pushing things, avoid trying to persuade someone to take that step. It has to come from them. And if they themselves continue to pursue you, accept their pursuit, without allowing your mind to get too carried away about your future. You'll just have to enjoy what that stage in each of your lives brings. Prepare to get hurt without expecting to get hurt. If it flourishes into something lasting and beautiful, that's wonderful. If it ends in the other in pursuit of a Man, you just have to see the beauty in that time that you had. It was still real but the complexities of life made it short lived. 

Good luck!

Nothing I thought of through all the years transpired,nada not one nightmare happened! I totally lost myself at that point! Later when I was having a very rough time,she would give me the best advice anyone ever could! She said dad you don't  have to belong to any group or be associated with a certain type of ppl! As long as you're happy is all that matters.Ill never forget that day the weight of the world was lifted gone in the wind! My daughter was my rock at that time! How ignorant I was  about it all!

> I am a 39 year old dude who has listened to primarily Metal since I was 13... I don't absolutely LOVE this song, though I do think it's pretty good in it's own way... Roan kinda reminds me of Stevie Nicks 80's vocal style (think Stop Dragging My Heart Around.) But the point of my comment here is that one of the best things about being a Metal fan is that because you listen to the more extreme side of music, you also have a wider capacity for music appreciation than most "normies" that stay in the confines of the center of Pop music. When I was a teenager around your age I was obsessed with Testament's Low and Madonna's Ray of Light albums at the exact same time and those two things could not be any more different from each other. I never get tired of Paula Abdul's "Straight Up." and I think Dua Lipa's Future Nostalgia is a perfect album. Good tunes is good tunes, regardless of who makes 'em and who they make 'em for. The reality is that if you enjoy it, it was made for you. Never be a slave to stereotypes. All Metal fans... and I really do mean all of us... we all have something in our collection that doesn't fit the stereotype. That's why all the Swedish Death Metal dudes love ABBA.

> @helenaterschegget8791  I understand what you are saying, but in this case he knew without a shadow of a doubt that he would lose his family forever. They were extremely extremely extremely hateful about gay people (think Westboro Baptist church kind of hate) and the bigger problem was that he hated himself. I think he could've dealt with being disowned, but it was the deeply instilled belief he had that he was simply born evil and broken and wrong. There were times where I thought he was really starting to accept himself and understand that he wasn't a disgusting and horrible person just for being gay. But then out of the blue he would have these meltdowns and just cry uncontrollably and I couldn't help him. He wouldn't even let me touch him during those times. And in our last year together it just kept getting worse and more frequent to the point that he would just leave for days or even a week at a time. I know it seems like we live in such accepting times, and in a lot of ways we do, but the reality is that there is also still a LOT of people that despise gay people and they often don't realize they are raising gay kids themselves that will grow up to be very very broken people.

> My condolences. I had a very similar reaction and was bawling my eyes out after actually listening to the lyrics of this song. My first girlfriend passed away on December 16th 2022 after jumping from the window of her apartment, after years of abuse from her extremely homophobic parents. We were still friends and I loved her so much, not as the love of my life but as a friend, as the girl who made my days brighter when we were teens and all messed up, as that person who I’d never go back to but who I would always be a friend to. She had been living in a heterosexual relationship at that point and I know she wasn’t happy... But I also had just moved countries and wasn’t checking properly on her. I torture myself a lot thinking what would’ve happened if I had answered the messages that I left on read, but at the time they seemed so innocuous, just talking about silly banter and I was so busy… Now I am married and it’s absolutely insanity to think that my wife never got a chance to meet her… They would’ve been good friends, I am sure of it. Sometimes it’s hard to believe she’s not here anymore, it’s like any day she’ll message me and ask me what I am up to. It hurts.

> I’m kind of annoyed by people leaving the intentionally sapphic part out. She’s very much telling lesbian stories. It’s more than another situationship because the reasons driving it are societal and internal. Don’t take that out of context just to make it relatable for yourself. You can relate but you don’t get to retell it without the sapphic framework because that’s detrimental to queer art. Situationship isn’t the same as someone can’t admit to themselves they’re a lesbian and is being warned they’re about to lose real love and wake up years down the line feeling numb being nothing but some man’s wife in a cishetnormative dynamic where her identity is swallowed up and she’s drinking it away but that’s not gonna stop her from loving women or make it hit less hard when she realizes how much time has passed and that it didn’t get easier but time isn’t gonna come back. You don’t relate to that if someone just won’t commit to you and you can move on and there’s no need to try making them the same because you don’t become at risk for becoming more or have risk for staying confined. Don’t retell y stories through cishet lens

> One thing I really appreciate about this song that most covers can't seem to simulate is the feeling of absurdism that this song has. This situation is obviously a painful situation, but when Chappell sings it it's with such detachment. She's joking about it (as the comic sans lyrics and animations also demonstrate). Most covers take this song at face value as a sad breakup song, but the energy that Chappell has here is a vital part of this song to me. This hyper energetic constant beat that's also light hearted in a specific way makes this song so powerful. And it doesn't even mean that the one singing this doesn't hurt. This type of over-energetic joking about it is a very typical coping mechanism. 
And this energy even helps to make the more serious bits stand out. The final "you have to stop the world just to stop the feeling" hits harder because the rest of the song goes so fast. 
All in all I simply appreciate the energy of this song a lot. As someone who has also had her fair share of situationships and heartbreak, it feels good to have a song that won't just swallow in the despair constantly

> It's a certain part in music, in the " traditional" writing of a song. It's commonly written like follows:
Verse
Chorus
Verus 
Chorus 
Bridge
Chorus

Something like that..And not all songs follow this outline. Taylor Swift has a song with no Chorus ( that's plural).  Every artist is different & can write however they choose.  But Generally speaking this is how many are. So in " Good luck.." the bridge is after the second Chorus where she sings " when u wake up with him in the middle of the night... ( Sorry! I'm not sure of the exact words so please don't bombard me with comments about such...) and the song crescendos or the anticipation builds. I freaking love " your standing face to face with I told you so!' Then softly, yet still building somehow " you know I hate to say ""I told you." Then continuing to the peak." I TOLD YOU SOOO!!" I always scream this at the top of my lungs then my voice goes out....lol.
And that is the bridge. Which is exactly the word for it. 
I should add there are more words in this bridge, I just tried to keep ot short with a brief description to help define bridge.

> As a big fan of MARINA (a previous top 0.01% listener on Spotify), I have to disagree.  I can see why people may think so because the type of music Chappell Roan is channeling is New Wave, a genre popular in the late 70s to early 80s. 

On my initial listen, I got Cyndi Lauper vibes. Her iconic song, "Girls Just Want To Have Fun" from the 1983 album, She's so Unusual .

"The phone rings, in the middle of the night
My father yells "What you gonna do with your life?"" (Girls Just Want To Have Fun) ,

and

"When you wake up next to him in the middle of the night
With your head in your hands, you're nothing more than his wife" (Good Luck, Babe!). 

In a way, MARINA has a new wave element (although, she's always experimenting with new sounds in every album). 

But no, her music does not remind me of MARINA. I think the big differences are the craftsmanship in lyrics/storytelling and vocal delivery. 

"Good luck, Babe!" is such a catchy bop! It's the only song I like from her. Her music isn't really my vibe, but I'm happy for her success. In conclusion, she's her own artist, frankly.

We met off line and she moved to my town for college. We had an amazing year. Then she...just disappeared.

I tried to be patient since I knew she was having troubles with family. I wanted to support her and be there for her. She would get even more stressed out so I backed off.

Then her telephone stopped working. (I just dated myself lmfao) I went to her place several times. No one answered the door until someone finally did.

A man.

I asked if he knew [girlfriend] is okay. Is she home?

He asked who I was and I said her girlfriend.

He just kind of blinked in confusion and said something like, "no. Not possible. I'm her fiance. We've been together for 3 years and getting married in two months."

I legit do not remember what happened after that or even the rest of that year. Nothing.

> Conversely, this song could be interpreted to be about about the consequences of trying to force someone else to not be who they truly are, as in, a bicurious woman who figured out it wasn't who she was, but her ex-girlfriend refused to accept that reality. For me to enjoy this song, I have to trust that Chappell somehow better understands the eponymous Babe's sexuality better than she herself does, confidently identifying her as a lesbian that returned to the closet, but that isn't the reality being shared by many in the comments. Bisexual women who have relationships with men are still bisexual and do not deserve to be condescended. I've only had successful relationships with other women when they're also bisexual, because too many lesbians think that way. And for the hottest take, every lesbian who dismisses or scorns those without a "gold star" is a misogynist through-and-through. Yes, I typed that right, not misandrist, but they're usually that too.

> El amor de mi vida me habló de esta canción. Me dijo: Verdad que vos te sentís como Chappel y yo soy el bi que está en el closet? Y pues fui corriendo a buscar la letra y... sí. Escucho esta canción a diario y me produce nostalgia y dolor. Yo lo amo tanto que no quiero que él viva infeliz en el amor. Si alguien lo llega a amar igual o más que yo, le sonreiría en el futuro y estaría feliz por él, pero si llega a tener una tapadera como novia o esposa y no la ama como me ama a mí, me dará mucha tristeza por él y me dolerá el corazón porque lo amo tanto que quiero que sea totalmente feliz con o sin mí (de preferencia conmigo, claro). Papito, siempre serás el dueño de mi palpitante corazón y estoy trabajando en mí mismo para mejorar mi autoestima, mi salud mental, mi estado físico, mi carácter y todas las áreas de mi vida para ser mejor para mí y para vos en caso que vuelvas a reclamar lo que te pertenece. Te amo con toda el alma.

> I still remember the girl i've spent my middle school life with in japan.  We were friends since elementary, but the countless times I've called her 'my angel' 'sweetheart' was unforgettable. I always said those words in unserious manner but it was just a cover up to not make things awkward. I really liked her, her short hair and soft demeanor was so beautiful. I 'happened' to like androgynous looking boys with similar atmosphere as hers after I had to change school and got separated from her. However, I always got uncomfortable whenever I date those men like her and their 'male' side appeared, I didn't know why. I'm Japanese, so same-sex romance is forbidden, I didn't even know it existed until 2 years ago. Now I know who I am. 
Dear Chihiro, if you happened to be in same shoe as me and reading this, I loved you and I still do. I know that you were diligent young child and was interested in studying english. I hope you are here.

> More her like marketing team knows this.. 😂 Everything these artists do, even down to formatting lyrics videos, is calculated by men in suits inside record label boardrooms following "market research". Enjoy any artist you want - totally fine - but be informed and don't fall for b.s. relatability DIY "omg she's just like us!" lore dreampt up by record label execs SOLELY to sell records and merch, and drive engagement/streams. Understand that the images of modern-day, major record label artists are completely manufactured. Understand that most of "fan twitter" for these major label artists is also smoke and mirrors - consisting mainly of disingenuous accounts operated by record label employees, paid followers,  engagement pod users, and straight up fake/A.I. accounts using bot scripts to generate hype. With Chappell Roan, specifically, her "rebrand" and subsequent rapid ascent reeks of similar tactics, in my humblest opinion.

> I lived the life your dad did, I lived “the straight life” because that’s what my family conditioned me into thinking I had to do and who I had to be. I’m 31. I came out to them when I was 13 and was told that I couldn’t be a Protestant (I’m from a mixed religion family) and gay aswell because being one was too shameful so I couldn’t be both as they are all homophobic too.. I came out completely and wasn’t living the conditioned life anymore, when my kids were 3, 18 months and 3 months old and it was the first thing in my life I done for myself.. I met my amazing fiancée, she became “mum” to our beautiful babies (I’m mummy), all of my own family I have absolutely nothing to do with them, but I made my own family and gained the family I always dreamt of having with my amazing fiancée and her incredible parents and family.. I’m so so far beyond happy things worked out for your dad,  yourself and your family 🥰

> ​​ @end-me- ​ your comment is very stupid and lack nuance. Many gay women and men got into heterosexual relationships back then due to social pressure. They didn't have all the freedoms we have today and they had 2 options: to live like social pariahs or to try to have a "normal" life. Most of people cannot live what many uncloseted gays lived through the 60s, 70s and 80s. They tried to live the "normal" life and failed and that IS PART OF LIFE to acknowledge that mistake and move on.

If you want to blame somebody, start with religion, then politics and then the society that forced this people to have a choice between living a lie or suffer with their sexuality.

You are not even sure what his wife thought or if she already pardoned him and cherished the time she shared with him, but HERE YOU ARE, SPREADING HATE when you don't even know what his mother think about it or what she had to say.

> ​@selohcin  the idea isn't that being a wife in general is automatically a bad thing, but the running theme of the song is that a woman suppressed strong feelings for another woman she had in the past so intensely, that she overcompensated by getting into a straight relationship specifically so she can fulfill the role of being a wife to a man. These are supposed to be describing how the wife realises she sees herself, not what she's being called. That she realised she is a wife not necessarily out of commitment to that guy, but fear of exploring the feelings she had for that other woman in the past, and trying to prove herself. 

That line is supposed to be introspection hitting as brutally as an emotional breakdown, it's supposed to be harsh. 

The good luck babe line is from the perspective of the woman she had feelings for who is out as queer, who feels for the woman who isn't.

Regardless of whether it's Eastern or Western, when reciting poetry there is a concept of "rhyming"! ?
Why does rhyme strike such a chord with us, along with harmony?
(Although it is a strange phenomenon for me when I occasionally feel like "?! It's not bad!" even with dissonance.)
It's good when melody and lyrics match subjectively, but it's also good when they simply feel like one melody, isn't it?
Thank you for your comment!

P.S.
Are you Spanish?
(There are countries in South and Central America where it is an official language!)
"Recuerdos de la Alhambra" is also a wonderful melody.
It's a melody that touches the heart!
The following melody is a song used in the ending of a movie, and it has a Southeast Asian feel.

> As a gay man, I've heard this story from a couple of guys before. Their boyfriends were from especially conservative families. As someone who is too, I want to help you with this. For some context, I think it's extremely tough to adapt to a new purpose in life. When you've been raised for so long with ideas of "the perfect life" being a conservative one with a wife, 2 kids and a white collar job, being gay feels like you're lost. It's very easy to want to just... run back to the familiar and do everything that your parents said you should do. That would bring the perfect life of happiness, right? 

It's an incredibly difficult feeling to shake off. So please do not blame yourself if you are. You brought him genuine love. You did the best you could. You deserve a future too, and I hope you're getting that. We need more loving people like you in this world.

> See, that's the thing. K. Dot ain't like me. He ain't angry. He ain't a bad dude. Kendrick is a good man. He's humble, and kind. He has a good heart. There's an old, old saying. "Demons flee the battlefield, when a kind man takes up arms and marches to war. For a kind man's rage at injustice is matched only by his compassion for his fellow man." And Kendrick is a very kind man.

Drake disses Kendrick? Nah. Not a big deal. Kendrick is a big man. He can take it. Ain't no reason for a king to concern himself with one unruly, wannabe, pathetic ass noble who only has the title cause he bought it, when the rest of the kingdom is happy and secure.

Drake sneak disses K. Dot's wife? That's enough to throw hands, but homie needs more than "dude could be talkin about 4 different nibbas (YT censorship -_-)

Drake disrespects legends like the late, great Tupac, and the still alive Snoop Dogg? Nah. Little bro needs to bleed over that. 

A real man, like Kendrick, can withstand any blow to his body, his mind, his name or even his reputation in defense of what he knows is right and true. So long as his family, his friends are spared the suffering, a real man would rather die on his feet in defense of those he protects. Drake disrespected not just K. Dot, but his wife, his kids, Snoop, and Tupac. 

In his position, I would've done the same thing. "Say what you want to about me, nibba, but don't you dare attack my family, or our legends. If you do, I'll kill you." I'm 100% on Kendrick's side here.

> Those shipping containers referencing trafficking is just the start of it. The fact that the background is repetitive and bland is representative of drakes/OVO's music. Repetitive and easily packaged for sale for consumption of the masses. Even though the shipping containers make up most of the visual space in the shot (representing sheer volume of Drake/OVO output), our eyes are naturally drawn to Kenny and Co. even though they're only making up a fraction of the scene. Its a subtle way of visually saying "you may have more output than me, but my art will always draw more attention and praise than the repetitive, copy and paste music you put out".

On top of that, the shipping containers are mostly white, with black accents. Kendrick is heavily critical of Drake in all of his disses saying that Drake only acts black when it's good for his publicity, sales numbers, and cultural relevance. The shipping containers being mostly white with the black accents is literally a visual representation of how Kendrick see's drake.

This video is literally visual poetry.

> Drake filed a defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG)—his and Kendrick Lamar's shared record label—in January 2025. The suit claimed UMG knowingly promoted and distributed Kendrick Lamar's diss track "Not Like Us", which included lyrics accusing Drake of serious misconduct (e.g., implying he is a pedophile), and that this constituted defamation.

The lawsuit targeted UMG's actions, not Kendrick Lamar directly.

A federal judge in New York dismissed the case in October 2025, ruling that the lyrics were protected as nonactionable opinion in the context of a rap battle, and that UMG could not be held liable for publishing them.

Drake appealed the dismissal in January 2026, arguing the ruling set a dangerous precedent for rap diss tracks.

As of February 2026, the appeal is ongoing with no reported resolution, settlement, or further dismissal.

(Note: This followed an earlier 2024 pre-action petition by Drake alleging UMG used bots to inflate streams of "Not Like Us," which he later withdrew in favor of the defamation suit.)

> Arguable is Drake started the fued. It could be argued it was Kendrick.  When Drake & J Cole did "First Person Shooter", Cole referred to the three as, "the big three," as previously raised by rap media.  That's not an insult.  Kendrick apparently doesn't like Drake - not an uncommon position - and responded in a verse on "Metro" containing, "F* the big three, there's just big me."

Arguably that's the line that started everything. Cole responded with a song he very quickly regretted and pulled from streaming, calling it a mistake and apologizing.

Drake, having only recently relented the top Pop spot to Taylor, couldn't back down as easily and... frankly his response songs have been as awful as most of his recent work, with the "best" shot being a jab at Kendrick being abusive which this video easily destroyed.

Anyway, I'm off track being that Drake didn't start this.  He continued it, sure.

Please note:
I'm in the GTO, but haven't liked a Drake song since, "Nice For What". "They Not Like Us" is song of the year easily.

> It's a beautiful diss. But defamation is real grounds to sue someone. And calling someone a pedophile without proper evidence is more than just an opinion. 
You can't sue someone for not liking you or telling people you're a lil bish. That's an opinion. If he just called him creepy that's also not grounds for a lawsuit.  It also has to be false. If someone is going around telling your truth, well...that's too bad. But, unless drake has been convicted, this is technically false and grounds for a defamation lawsuit. Also, Drake is a little weenie for filing a lawsuit. He should have just put out a song. 
But also beyoncé has filed some lawsuits for defamation against podcasters and media outlets that have insinuated that she had anything to do with diddy's charges. I think she's entitled to a lawsuit.

If you really go line for line, Drake had better bars. The industry wanted Drake to lose, the culture wanted Drake to lose, so they say he lost. I like KDOT’s songs better, but when it came to dis tracks, Drakes line were funnier and hit harder. That “breeding resentment, MJ - Jermaine , etc… hands down funnier than any of this. That’s why KDOt still running the same song over and over, then had to get a whole West coast video shoot. KDOt ain’t rapped on no West coast rap in forever, but needed a win and most people are suckers for a hook and a good beat. But if we really honest, Drakes lines were just better.

> Drake fans in the comments have my dying 💀 they either still pressed and intentionally came to a Kendrick video to try to defend drake (y'all obsessed) or they're secretly Kendrick fans and came to watch the video 😂 cuz why else are they here. I still had respect for drake as an artist at least after the whole beef cuz he has some good songs but after this lawsuit thing I don't have any respect for him because he's such a hypocrite and such a Karen 😂 I can't even bring myself to listen to some of his older songs now because of all the contradictions "cease and desist are for hoes" 😂 HE literally said that so he's calling himself out. Like wtf is he doing. He's destroying his legacy

> You are right , after the rapper told corrupt  evil lies on Kendrick Lamar,  dissed many other rappers with his lies , and disrespected Queen Rihanna and many other queens in the music industry.  He was happy when he got away with lying and speaking corrupt  words about other artists . He got angry after other artists  dissed him with lies . He isn't  right .  I want Aubrey Graham and Kendrick Lamar to stop their beef and for Drake to stop taking his beef with Kendrick  out on other artists.  We want Kendrick Lamar and  Drake to stop being angry with each other and to make peace with one another in Jesus' Name.  God loves them and their families.

> ​@CRISTIANBARRETO-v1n  what about if they rapped about issues such as pedophiles in the industry and calling them out? How its not acceptable? What if they talked about issues still present in our country from years of slave labor that was mishandled by corrupt politicians? Important topics like that? Would you complain then bc that's literally what you are doing. Get your head out of the dirt talking about a$$ and titties. A rapper brings up legit issues and you're complaining.  It's been the number one song for the third week and that speaks volumes that our country loves a song calling out pedophiles. How did you miss that message?

> No one ever talks the truth. For example, Nas was about to destroy tupac but pac pulled up on him, told him a diss is coming out to East Coast, but i dont want you getting involved so nas didnt, Snoop Dog tells that story ln interviews. Fast forward SchoolboyQ told cole a diss going out, if we cool, dont get involved and going forward we gon leave you out. Please know Jid spoke on being ready for war. A Dreamville vs TDE beef would break hip-hop, too many lyrical  killers thats gonna speak truth and real shit on both sides. Would love to see Lute vs Ab or jid vs jay rock or Bas vs Q, Ari vs Sza, cole vs k dot. Shit would be madness. 😂

Got washed on Black Friday by Kendrick.

Let NoName drag him into defending himself for BLM and tried gracefully making peace just for her to smack his hand.

Begged for smoke for years just to run.

Doesn’t even like violence/beef .

Doesn’t have killer mentality.

Shades and Sly’s rappers on track (False Prophets/1985) and in person tries to play the Deescalating Uncle. 

He doesn’t even artistically make bold claims or take as many risks as Drake OR Kendrick. Kendrick has followed through on every claim he’s made . Jcole is not CUT.

But one thing I can say is that Drake can't come back from this. This is beyond what anyone expected. Brooooo, Kendrick killed, destroyed, anhilated, etc to Drake. What a time to be alive.

And to think that Dave Free (the "alleged" father of Kendrick's son) directed the video, that was insane. W video 🔥🔥🔥🔥

What’s creepy is that Kendrick Lamar even included this line in his song. So does that mean Kendrick Lamar knows something about the Epstein files? 😱
I’m saying this because if you watch HOSTEL parts 1–3, you’ll understand what I mean. And the song’s title is “Not Like Us” 😱 — that makes it even creepier.
Could Kendrick also be involved in the Epstein files? Just asking.

### 1. @lnkA_4 (2114 chars)

> ты поёшь и говоришь что любишь - 
а шаги твои едут по всем кто есть у тебя есть -
скучаешь -
но с собой не забираешь
7 год уже как -
одно и тоже повторяешь
любовь нашу не продвигаешь_
жизнь уходит -
и я вместе с ней
у тебя нет меня -
прилетай забери скорей,
думаешь так напишу?
Я могу всё бросить уезжать-
такие ошибки что любить( в прошлом оставлять)
Ко мне быстрее пришёл ангел в живую с небес-
Чем ты на своём верталёте, или самалёт на встречу по Земле -
из Республики Кореи 
на Респулику Молдова.
Ангел пришёл забрать и уежать моё прошлое-сердце-душа-шаги 
ЧИСТЫ
Так и написанно в Связенной Писаний:
те что с чистом сердцем - Бога и увидят.
Бог увидел мои плачущие глаза по тебе
И сколько боли было мне
Ожидая, Верья, Молясь.
Нет любви ко мне -
так и скажи
Я Бога не буду дальше и больше мучить о твоей любви ко мне.
Нету у тебя я-
А ВЕДЬ ВСЕГДА Я ТЕБЕ РЯДОМ НУЖНО БЫЛА.
Если так сильно мою любовь принимаешь
зачем тогда меня в безну отпускаешь
Зачем любовь оставляешь
Зачем не прилетаешь
Зачем так отпускаешь
Зачем сердце мне страдать заставлляешь
Зачем -
ТЫ МНЕ НЕ ДОВЕРЯЕШЬ?
Если ты бы не любит
Во снах мне не приходил.
Раждаетья человек один раз в своей жизни на Земле -
Истинную любовь встречает один раз в своей жизни на Земле -
Умирает человек один раз в своей жизни на Земле.
Когда любовь теряет_
Никто и не что не сможет его душу собственную снова помочь увидать по жизни своей любовь на Земле.
Пак Чимин!
Тебе есть дело до мне,
Гле Ты?
Мне оставлять тебя?
МНЕ УЕЖАТЬ ОТ ТЕБЯ- ТВОЕЙ ДУШИ?
МНЕ ЗАБЫВАТЬ ТЕБЯ?
ТЫ НЕ ПОВСТРЕЧАЕШЬ МЕНЯ НИКОГДА.
ТЫ ЗАБЕРЁШЬ МЕНЯ?
ТЫ ЛЮБИШЬ МЕНЯ?
ТВОЁ СЕРДЦЕ БЪЁТЬСЯ ДЛЯ МЕНЯ?
ТЫ - ВИДИШЬ ВО СНЕ МЕНЯ?
Я ТЕБЕ НУЖНА?
ТОГДА ПОМОГИ ПОНИМАТЬ -
ПОСЕМУ Я ТУТ ОДНА.
Я ДЕЙСТВИТЕЛЬНО СОВСЕМ ОСТАЛОСЬ ЖИТЬ В ДОМЕ ПАПЫ ОДНА, ЛИШЬ ПИТОМЦЫ ДА И ВСЁ - А ЕЩЁ И ХОЛОД.
И ДА И ГОЛОД.
КАК СЧИТАЕШЬ БУДУ Я ЖИВА НА ПРИХОД ТЕБЯ?
Я В ЖИВУЮ АНГЕЛУ СВЯТОМУ - БОГУ, СКАЗАЛА НЕТ, Я С ВАМИ НЕ ПОЙДУ -
Я СВОЮ ЛЮБОВЬ ЖДУ.
ИМЕЙ СМЕЛОСТЬ ПРИЛЕТАТЬ И ЗАБИРАТЬ.
ИМЕЙ МУДРОСТЬ БОГА БОЯТЬСЯ.
ИМЕЙ ВЗРЕЛОСТЬ -
СЕРДЦЕМ В ЖИВУЮ ОБНИМАТЬСЯ.
Я ПРИЕДУ В ТВОЮ КОРЕЮ ЛИШЬ С ТОБОЙ.
Я ДОЛГО НЕ ЖДУ - 
ПРИЛЕТАЙ ЗА МНОЙ.

> Who Lyrics

We never met, but she's all I see at night
Never met, but she's always on my mind
Wanna give her the world and so much more
Who is my heart waitin' for?
If every day I think about her
Yeah, every day of my life
Then tell me why I haven't found her
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?

So many people to see (so many people to see, to see, to see)
Places to go (so many places to go), we still haven't found hello
We never met, but she's all I see at night
Never met, but she's always on my mind
Wanna give her the world and so much more
Who is my heart waiting for?

I'll take her places they ain't found yet
I'll put it all on the line
I'll be that someone she can count on
One, two, three, four, five
So many people to see (so many people to see, to see, to see)
Places to go (so many places to go), we still haven't found hello

We never met, but she's all I see at night
Never met, but she's always on my mind
Wanna give her the world and so much more
Who is my heart waiting for?
Is she someone that I see every day?
Is she somewhere a thousand miles away?
Wanna give her the world and so much more
Who is my heart waiting for?

Heart waiting for?
(Who is my heart?) Heart waiting for?
(Who is my heart?) Heart waiting for?
(Who is my?) Who is my heart waiting for?
We never met, but she's all I see at night
Never met, but she's always on my mind
Wanna give her the world and so much more
Who is my heart waiting for?
Is she someone that I see every day? (Oh)
Is she somewhere a thousand miles away? (A thousand miles away)
Wanna give her the world and so much more (and so much more)
Who is my heart waiting for?

> ​ @chrissturkenboom6080  To be nominated at the VMAs, the company MUST SUBMIT a certain singer's song, which is the only way to be nominated. It doesn't matter how big a hit your song is. If the company doesn't submit your song, you are NOT NOMINATED. PERIOD. 
But Bighit didn't submit any of Jimin's solo songs such as Like Crazy last year and WHO this year, so he didn't even had a chance to compete with other singers. Jimin WAS ROBBED.  
Instead Bighit submitted Jk's Seven again this year, which was released last year, so it was submitted to the VMAs twice, and other songs of other groups under Hybe whose records and popularity are NOT even half close to Jimin's. It's utterely UNFAIR for Jimin!! The discrimination againts Jimin in HYBE and Bighit is suffocating and disgusting. 
But many fans do not even know the truth so they say Jimin is not worthy of being nominated at the VMAs.
Considering all the sabotage this fvckin company has done to Jimin for so long a time, that is exactly what the disgusting company had planned and that makes my blood boil.
So if anyone says, Jimin didn't get any awards at the VMAs, tell them it's all because of the fvckin company didn't submit his songs to the VMS, but instead wanted to give all the glory to their favorites. Because they know damn well Jimin always has the highest chance to win if competing fairly!

>  @_birdie   oh yes. I agree with that. But I feel like when bts will be back they will bring back kpop with them. I feel like the english songs are to reach a wider audience for them to understand the actual lyrics as well as vibing to the song. Because I know many ARMYs who go with the songs without knowing the real meaning behind them. I feel like the last 2 bts songs, Take Two and YTC are kpop though. Specially YTC, it goes through all memories bts made together, and ofcourse there are english lyrics included with the korean ones, but so does every other kpop song no? I am not trying to sound rude. Sorry if it sounds like that. I personally am not a massive fan of this solo period, but if it helps bts clear their thoughts and feel better, then I'm happy with anything and everything they do. I feel like when they all come back we will get another 3rd gen kpop masterpiece! Waitinggg

Jeon vidal také dlouhohrající desku která je velmi úspěšná po celém světě, a mám za to, že  spíva líp než Park. I Hope má dobrý klip k písničce. RM také. Tak nerozumím, tomu proč jen Park. To je vychcaný, falešný, namišlený, naládoví člověk, který jak jsem napsal jen vše dělal ve svůj prospěch, jimi líto Jeona kterého jen využil ve svuj prospěch.  Pokud mám informace tak mezi němi to skončilo.  Myslím si, že  Jeon udělal dobře, že začal chodit z Taem ten není takoví jak Park. Je třeba se podívat i z jiné stránky na Parka.

And just for your information. V is the most handsome man in the world for 2024 on the websites of the magazines TechnoSports, GeeksForGeeks, AWBI, StrawPoll and now he is fighting for the first place on the website Nubia. So please refrain from commenting on V and as I already wrote, you'd better stream, or does 6.5M streams in 16 hours seem like enough to you???
Video is about Jimin, so don't drag here V.
By the way, mocking emoticons are a sign of childishness in my opinion. Are you not a teenager by accident???

 Everyone knows all levels of choreography and musicality are touched by him his own company has said it throughout his career his friends people he worked with... He knows his voice is different and not for everyone

Because from 'Face' being his first solo album holding so much vulnerability and rawness, honestly speaking his fears and scars, he came back with his 2nd album 'Muse' being the bolder one, unafraid of expressing his love towards someone. This just speaks of how much creative jimin is as an artist, he always comes back better and never forgetting to include stories behind it. Everything is perfectly prepared. Park Jimin showcase growth, development & rebirth with 'Muse'. 🙇🏼‍♀️

No one will ever reach this high. All other international K-pop success is directly due to BTS, even though I know groups like Stray Kids, and TXT  have worked hard internationally ,they still would never have gotten worldwide attention if BTS had not trailed the way!!!!!

>  @Nakata04  А мне вот не напоминает. Напоминает может стиль 2000 годов - вот и все. Там такие авторы и продюсеры у этой песни... - они бы никогда не допустили плагиата. И не надо обвинять Чимина в хитрости, он ни у кого ничего не украл. Не нравится - не слушайте, а обвинять в обмане некрасиво, если  конечно вы Army, а не антифанатка Чимина (а такие здесь постоянно ошиваются)... 
Кстати это единственная песня из альбома, в создании которой Чимин не принимал  личное участие, как автор. А исполнил он её великолепно!! Браво, наш Король!!

>  @Inoka-p4f 😭 the song still broke records though for eg ‘Jimin's "Who" becomes the longest-running no. 1 by a K-pop soloist in Billboard Global 200 chart history’ and many more achievements and just so y’all don’t take everything too seriously every fandom claims their artists song as soty or as it deserves to be soty it was just a statement said by an army (me) and my whole point was that it’s deserving of that and if it didn’t it’s alright he still slayed so...congrats for Kendrick 🎉 no one’s upset or smtg anyways...

>  @Малинка-ь2н  Нет, это голос Чимина)) Обычно так же, как вы, пишут те, кто вообще не слушал его песен, потому что они не могут поверить, что у реального человека может быть такой нереальной красоты голос. Да, у нашего Чимина такой красивый голос! Послушайте акустическую версию песни, выступление на шоу Джимми Фэллона или вообще любое выступление на концертах группы - у Чимина нереальной высоты и необыкновенной красоты голос, не зря же все реакционеры аж подскакивают на его сольных партиях в групповых песнях.

>  @chicken8888ec it does NOT freeze view count, stop spreading rumours when you clearly have done no research. Emojis function like any other character on the keyboard - using a particular character in the comments has no bearing on the view count whatsoever. What freezes views is spamming any characters at all, because the algorithm will think you are a bot. So spamming NO EMOJI will mean that your views don’t count. You are the ones causing the problem, not people using one or two emojis in a comment. 🤡

> [Verse 1]
And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

[Chorus]
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

[Verse 2]
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour

[Pre-Chorus]
Comin' down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about
No, no, no

[Chorus]
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater, woah

[Bridge]
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah

[Chorus]
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold for you here
Now, let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And it's too cold, it's too cold

Put my finger on your tongue 'cause you love to taste, yeah
These hearts adore, everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour
Coming down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no
'Cause it's too cold
For you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold
For you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
'Cause it's too cold
For you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
It's too cold
For you here
And now, let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
And it's too cold, it's too cold
The hands of my sweater

> All I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach
But I stand in California with my toes in the sand

Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that wouldn't wanna tell you about no

'Cause it's too cold whoa
For you here and now
So let me hold whoa
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides our minds to
So move to a place so far away

The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste yeah

These hearts adore,
Every other beat the other one beats for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour

Coming down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no no

'Cause it's too cold whoa
For you here

One day, my friend's son (who had no idea who they were) was rocking a The Neighbourhood tshirt. The lead singer saw him and said "Nice Shirt". The son said "They're all right but I got this shirt on sale". He had no clue who he was talking to and was mortified when he found out.

What made me freeze is the fact that when I used to listen to this song I was majorly addicted to pain killers, and an alcoholic. It immediately took me back to that time and those horrible memories. Good news is I have been sober from it all for 5 years now. Life is good.

> OKAY GUYS! Storytime. (There's an update in the end)
  I became friends with a guy from my economy class in 9th grade. Let´s call him J. Shortly something happened and you could almost cut the tension between us and serve like a piece of cherry pie. Butwhen I found out he has a girlfriend i stopped talking to J because I didn´t want to break the couple.
 Then after some time, during summer vacation he asked me out, I said no. Again, I wanted J even as a friend, but turned out his gf was MEGA jealous so i didn´t want him to have problems because of me. 
After some time, already in 10 grade my friend told me her boyfriend(the best friend of J) heard that at the time J asked me out he broke up with his girfriend and wanted to ask me on a date because he liked me all this time. We started talking again because I missed him and I was sorry I ignored him. J was back with his gf again, but I was extremely friendly, like calling J "bro" all the time and stuff. We went on long walks in nature in beatiful places and we found more things we have in common. I realized I start falling for him even more. 
Then, he asked me out to go to the swimming pool with him, with his girfriend and J's friend. The girl was very passive-agressive and tried insulting me subtly. I understood she was angry J talked to me. So although I tried showing her I'm not gonna try to steal her bf and we spent nice time fooling around and talking about Marvel, I decided I have to stop this. I liked him more and I didn't want his gf to start agruing with him. So I stopped talking to him this much, then we stopped texting each-other at all. I missed him, but I thought it was right.
Now my friend calls me and tells me J broke up with his gf because she was cheating on him with nearly every his friend and now was dating with one of his best friends. My friend's boyfriend heard J talking about me and how he still has feelings for me, but we stopped talking and he thinks I don't like him at all.
I texted him today and I am gonna go out with him. I will not act like I'm not interested anymore. There's nothing holding us back now and I'll make our date special. If everything is gonna be romantic and cute I'm gonna kiss him the day we meet. I don't care. I want him happy. And I will make him happy.

❤️❤️❤️UPDATE:
I went to my first party and got crazy drunk only with two drinks. Then I kissed a random girl there but then climbed a wall and started crying, texting J how I'm sorry that I kissed some girl a day before we had a date. He was worried if I'm okay and totally confused why I felt bad. I told him because I liked him for two years now and he said he likes me too. Then he asked if I want to be his girlfriend. I said yes. 
Then the next day we met and went to the city. We met on the bus stop to take a bus. He asked again if I want to be his girlfriend officially and after I say yes he politely asked if he can kiss me. That day we spent laughing, talking and just being silent, holding hands, putting our head together, hugging and kissing. Not french kisses or anything. But ones filled with love. We went to the park and he was blushing all the time because of me. To my mind were coming up amazing poetic and romantic things to say. After we rolled down the hill and him, lying on the grass while I was standing on my knees and stroking his hair, asked me, laughing "How can this day be even more like a romantic movie?".
Sometimes he was zoning out looking me and then blush and say "Oh Gosh... How beautiful you are! I am the luckiest man in the whole city". We talked a lot. Once he said "I don't get it. How is it possible to have this deep tranquility and being nervous at the same time when I'm with you?".
I was so fluttered when he said "You are too smart for me. No, really, some things you say are unforgettable." Then we had some time before the bus back so we went to buy my favourite lipbalm that is sold only in one shop. We went there and he was amazed there'are lipbalms that smell and taste like coca-cola, sprite, fanta, chupa-chups, etc. I asked what is his favorite fizzy drink.  He said sprite, I just silently took the sprite lipbalm and went to the checkout. He was so flushed. 
We spent the whole day telling each-other our past, sharing the plans for our future and enjoying the present. 
Gosh, I love him so much.

> This video makes me think. He is in love. I mean the title itself says it: He wants to be her's! He starts off weak, tired, and consumed with darkness. How long does he take to get up? He can hardly do it. Then, when she meets her, he's obsessed. He follows her every move and is always looking at her; where is she? How can he get to her? 

What makes my point so beautiful and impactful is that at 1:47, he is back on the floor again. This time, there is a difference. How long is he laying on the floor this time around? It is transitory; it is minuscule in comparison to when we first meet him. Does he struggle as much? No. His movements and actions are no longer dolorous. She was able to heal and take away his sorrows. 

But, as she does, she is no longer light. She is more defined with dark lines and she is no longer floating; she is weighed down my burden. As the story progresses, she loses her innocence. In the beginning she was like wind: light and free! At the end, she is more human like and is always on the ground. The only thing she has hope for or can look up to is him. He is all that matters now. She wants to be his so desperately. That is what he wanted right?

No. He wanted the version of her he created. The character he lusted after. Not the true, raw, and complex angel that she was.

The ending makes me sad and unsure about humanity. All he wanted was to be her's, yet as soon as he got her and was able to touch and connect with her, she no longer had value. She is now something he has and he is no longer fighting for her. 

How does he view himself?  If he does not love or value himself, he cannot love nor value anything he has or owns. She was not worth as much anymore because she was now his.

The woman on the other hand who starts off light, free, and energetic, calms down. She feels safe with him; she finally trusts him. 

And, as soon as she does, he loses interests. 

This is great depiction of love vs. lust! 

"I wanna be yours"

In what ways does he want to be her's? 

It is as if he is manipulating her. He is playing with her, using her, spinning her, and mending her when he was in a state of sorrow. Now he is out of his misery he has no need for her. But, she now wants to be his. 

He paid attention to her. For God's sake, he chased after her...HE WANTED TO BE HER'S!! And now nothing? What happened? Why would he do that? As soon as she felt comfortable and safe with him, he left. 

But, what if they both know that the relationship is not stable? What if they know that the only way to preserve their beings is by letting each other go?

Notice in the final scenes how she guides his hand up and slowly pushes it away. She is setting a boundary: "I cannot be yours in that manner." 

With this action, she is asking: "Are you willing to meet me where I am?"  "Do you truly want to be mine?" 

She even extends her arm out, making the path to her longer but in the end, he was not willing to compromise. He leaves.

He did not love her for the complex human being that she was. If he truly loved her, would he have not exhibited the deep passion and devotion he initially gave her?

As he leaves, she is not chasing as she usually does. She hesitates a little, but she knows that in order for both of them to thrive and be happy, they have to let each other go. 

xoxo,
ly💞

> I'll never forget 2023..
The year I got to know her.. Spent the first 10 months knowing her.. Becoming one with her.. Then June to August the best 3 months of my life... I had never been that happy in my life.. I had fallen in love in ways I never knew that existed... loved the way she would eat food..
Smile.. Laugh.. Walk.. Use her hands while talking.. Just basic things in life..
And from being my Goodmorning to Goodnight.. Being my blocked calendar through the day.. She just walked out as though nothing ever took place..
She just left and never turned back to see how was I doing.. What was I going through..
From planning my future with her to not knowing what to do next.. I'll never forget that journey..
It's going to be 5 Months since she left..
And I really don't know how to forget her.. Every time I look at the gallery I see the moments I never knew would become a memory..
All I can do is wish that I could erase and move on.. But I just can't.

I just keep coming back to this song.. Cause I had found this song when I had fallen in love with her and before I could ask her out I used to listen to this song with an anticipation that someday I'll be hers and she will be mine.. It used to hurt to not have her.. 💔
And now I listen to this song after she is gone.. 💔
Why did I have to fall in love with someone who was never going to be mine.. Why did I get pain I never deserved.. Why am I not able to move on while the other person is already happy.. 🤕
Worse part about all of this is that even though she gave me pain.. In all that pain I still chose to love her.. And I'm soo stupid that I still do 💔

DON'T EVER LET THIS SONG DIE ❤️✨

> My fav song so I will do this😭
I wanna be your vacuum cleaner breathing in your dust
I wanna be your ford cortina
I will never rust 
If you like your coffee hot
Let me be your coffee pot
You call the shots, babe
I just wanna be yours
Secrets I’ve held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought 
Maybe I just wanna be yours
I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours
Let me be your leccy meter
And I’ll never run out
Let me be your portable heater
That you’ll get cold without
I wanna be your setting lotion (wanna be)
Hold your hair in deep devotion (I’ll be)
At least as deep as the Pacific Ocean 
Now I wanna be yours secrets I’ve held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought 
Maybe I just wanna be yours 
I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours 
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours 
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours 
Wanna be yours
(Wanna be yours)
I wanna be your vacuum cleaner (wanna be yours)
Breathing in your dust (wanna be yours) 
I wanna be your ford catrina (wanna be yours)
I will never rust (wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (wanna be yours)
Song writers:Alex turner/John cooper Clark

## 🎵 Love Me Not
**Artists:** Ravyn Lenae

### 1. @eulorialicious (2477 chars)

> Lyrics:
---------------------------------------------------
See, right now, i need you, i'll meet you somewhere now
You up now, i see you, i get you, take care now
Slow down, be cool, i miss you, come here now
It's yours now, keep it, i'll hold out until now
I need you right now, once i leave you i'm strung out
If i get you,
I'm slowly breaking down

And, oh, it's hard to see you
But i wish you were right here
Oh, it's hard to leave you when i get you everywhere
All this time i'm thinking we could never be a pair
Oh, no, i don't need you, 
but i miss you, come here

And, oh, it's hard to see you
But i wish you were right here
Oh, it's hard to leave you when i get you everywhere
All this time i'm thinking, i'm strong enough to sink it
Oh, no, i don't need you,
But i miss you, come here

He love me not,
He loves me
He holds me tight,
Then lets me go
He love me not,
He loves me
He holds me tight,
Then lets me go

Soon as you leave me,
we always lose connection
It's gettin' messy, 
I fiend for your affection 
Don't loosen your grip got a hold on me 
Now, forever, Let's get back together

Lord, take it so far away
I pray that, god,
We don't break
I want you to take me up and down
And round and round again 

And, oh, it's hard to see you
But i wish you were right here
Oh, it's hard to leave you when i get you everywhere 
All this time i'm thinking we could never be a pair

Oh, no, i don't need you,
But i miss you, come here
And, oh, it's hard to see you
But i wish you were right here
Oh, it's hard to leave you 
When i get you everywhere 
All this time i'm thinking, i'm strong enough to sink it
Oh, no, i don't need you,
But i miss you, come here

He love me not,
He loves me
He holds me tight, 
Then lets me go
He love me not,
He loves me
He holds me tight,
Then lets me go

He love me not,
He loves me
He holds me tight,
Then lets me go

He love me not,
He loves me
He holds me tight,
Then lets me go

You're gonna say that you're sorry at the end of the night
Wake up in the morning, 
Everything's alright
At the end of the story,
You're holdin' me tight 
I don't need to worry, 
Am i out of my mind?

And, oh,
It's hard to see you
But i wish you were right here
Oh, it's hard to leave you when i get you everywhere

All this time i'm thinking, i'm strong enough to sink it
Oh, no, i don't need you
But i miss you, come here
---------------------------------------------------
My hands hurts from typing all of that welp, 
Hope y'all have a great day :33

> See, right now, I need you, I'll meet you somewhere now
You up now, I see you, I get you, take care now
Slow down, be cool, I miss you, come here now
It's yours now, keep it, I'll hold on until now
I need you right now, once I leave you I'm strung out
If I get you, I'm slowly breaking down

[Chorus]
And, oh, it's hard to see you, but I wish you were right here
Oh, it's hard to leave you when I get you everywhere
All this time I'm thinking we could never be a pair
Oh, no, I don't need you, but I miss you, come here
And, oh, it's hard to see you, but I wish you were right here
Oh, it's hard to leave you when I get you everywhere
All this time I'm thinking, I'm strong enough to sink it
Oh, no, I don't need you, but I miss you, come here

[Post-Chorus]
He love me not, he loves me
He holds me tight, then let's me go
He love me not, he loves me
He holds me tight, then let's me go

[Verse 2]
Soon as you leave me, we always lose connection
It's gettin' messy, I think that your affection
Don't loosen your grip, got a hold on me
Now, forever, let's get back together

[Pre-Chorus]
Lord, take it so far away
I pray that, God, we don't break
I want you to take me up and down
And round and round again

[Chorus]
And, oh, it's hard to see you, but I wish you were right here
Oh, it's hard to leave you when I get you everywhere
All this time I'm thinking we could never be a pair
Oh, no, I don't need you, but I miss you, come here
And, oh, it's hard to see you, but I wish you were right here
Oh, it's hard to leave you when I get you everywhere
All this time I'm thinking, I'm strong enough to sink it
Oh, no, I don't need you, but I miss you, come here

[Post-Chorus]
He love me not, he loves me
He holds me tight, then let's me go
He love me not, he loves me
He holds me tight, then let's me go
He love me not, he loves me
He holds me tight, then let's me go
He love me not, he loves me
He holds me tight, then let's me go

[Bridge]
You gotta say that you're sorry at the end of the night
Wake up in the morning, everything's alright
At the end of the story, you're holdin' me tight
I don't need to worry, am I out of my mind?

[Chorus]
And, oh, it's hard to see you, but I wish you were right here (I'm losing my mind)
Oh, it's hard to leave you when I get you everywhere
All this time I'm thinking, I'm strong enough to sink it
Oh, no, I don't need you, but I miss you, come here

> See, right now, I need you, I'll meet you somewhere now
You up now, I see you, I get you, take care now
Slow down, be cool, I miss you, come here now
It's yours now, keep it, I'll hold out until now
I need you right now, once I leave you I'm strung out
If I get you, I'm slowly breaking down
And, oh, it's hard to see you, but I wish you were right here
Oh, it's hard to leave you when I get you everywhere
All this time I'm thinking we could never be a pair
Oh, no, I don't need you, but I miss you, come here
And, oh, it's hard to see you, but I wish you were right here
Oh, it's hard to leave you when I get you everywhere
All this time, I'm thinking I'm strong enough to sink it
Oh, no, I don't need you, but I miss you, come here
He love me not, he loves me
He holds me tight then lets me go
He love me not, he loves me
He holds me tight then lets me go
Soon as you leave me, we always lose connection
It's gettin' messy, I fiend for your affection
Don't loosen your grip, got a hold on me
Now, forever, let's get back together
Lord, take it so far away
I pray that, God, we don't break
I want you to take me up and down
And 'round and 'round again
And, oh, it's hard to see you, but I wish you were right here
Oh, it's hard to leave you when I get you everywhere
All this time I'm thinking we could never be a pair

He love me not, he loves me
He holds me tight then lets me go
He love me not, he loves me
He holds me tight then lets me go
He love me not, he loves me
He holds me tight then lets me go
You gotta say that you're sorry at the end of the night
Wake up in the morning, everything's alright
At the end of the story, you're holdin' me tight
I don't need to worry, am I out of my mind?
And, oh, it's hard to see you, but I wish you were right here (I'm losing my mind)
Oh, it's hard to leave you when I get you everywhere
All this time I'm thinking, I'm strong enough to sink it
Oh, no, I don't need you, but I miss you, come here

> Paulo Dybala arrived in Turin as a promise.
Young, quiet, almost fragile.
But Juventus was a place where promises are tested by fire.

At first, he was just a number.
Then a goal.
Then a celebration that became a symbol.

Night after night, Dybala turned fear into magic.
Left foot like poetry, movements like destiny.
When the stadium went silent, he spoke with the ball.

He wore the number 10 — not a shirt, but a weight.
Legends had worn it before him.
Some said it was too heavy.
He carried it anyway.

There were injuries.
Doubts.
Whispers that he was not enough.

But every time Juventus needed a soul,
Dybala answered.

Free kicks in the dark.
Goals when hope was fading.
Moments that cannot be measured in trophies.

Juventus gave him a stage.
Dybala gave Juventus emotion.

And when the goodbye finally came,
it wasn’t loud.
It was heavy.

Because some players don’t leave as winners or losers.
They leave as memories.

Paulo Dybala didn’t just play for Juventus.
He became part of its heartbeat.

Forever.]

> Great comment, simply because I can't see that, but if it had sounded like a 50s/60s/70s/80s song and maybe even a 90s song I'd have been able to see it. But that's just cos of my age. I've wondered can young people today hear a 00s song and figure out that it's a 00s song just by the sound of it, the same as I could take a good guess that an 80s song I've never heard before is an 80s song (e.g. Tinseltown in the Rain or I Wanna Know What Love Is or Broken Wings). But what you're all hearing with this song is not unlike how Leave the Door Open, Fascination (by Alpha Beat) or Finesse sound (for me anyway): 70s, 80s, and late 80s/early 90s in that order.

>  @andrewsparkes6275 You don’t know what you’re talking about then. It was the golden age of song writing and producing. This era was born out of 80’s nostalgia with powerful and catchy lyrics. Adele, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, Bruno Mars, Nicki Minaj, Little Mix, Lana Del Rey and that’s the tip of the iceberg. It doesn’t matter if you like them or think they rivaled Whitney Houston, Queen, Michael Jackson. That’s not the point melodically all it was another golden era of pop music. Bad Romance, Someone Like You, Who Run The World (Girls), Marry You are just a few.

> Let me tell you why. Musically the melody is repetitive and has no "resolution" in its chorus - each sentence ends with a similar higher note, which doesn't give the song a closure. This could be intentional - to give you a feeling of something missing that matches the lyrics.  Although music is up to everyone's individual interpretation, personally I don't quite appreciate that. Some also commented here that it made them feel uncomfortable.  The silence in the first 18 seconds of the 3.5 minute video doesn't help either.

Whenever I hear this song on my earphones, I imagine a beautiful nature scene or some quiet place, and one lonely person who is always alone even among a lot of people around him/her. No wonder the video has only 42 million views and not over 100 million because the people watching the video didn't get the same vibe when they listen the only audio version. I barely even watched the full video myself 😢

If the girl that was singing it had blue eyes and blonde hair it might be more popular. Sad to say but the reality is that it has always been that way. Even though the people who look more like Ravyn are the creators of all the elements in popular music today. You know what I mean.

>  @deimontrek se llama historia y contexto cultural, lo que crees que son tus valores puristas presuntamente mejor que el de los demás, solo es una imposición de la estética “vanguardista” de occidente medio, Europa y sus vueltas aparentemente elitistas.

Este tema por otra parte, encarna la historia de algo que empezó en las calles, de una sociedad, como el rap en New York que ganó grammy y tiene su propia estatuilla; también darle un grammy a este tema es representar la cultura latina y caribeña, una sociedad que en el mainstream nunca se les ha visibilizado si no es con el canon estético europeo donde todo tiene que ser en inglés o europeo para ser vanguardista. Quítate ese velo pa, que tú también haces parte de la historia de este tema pues contigo van las raíces de aquellas tribus africanas que crearon los primeros sonidos de la historia, especialmente el bum bap de esa canción.

Realiza que eres un grano de arena en la historia que debe manifestar y representar esta canción más allá de lo superficial que lo ves, hay peores canciones en inglés que solo por ser en inglés son “mejores” aparentemente. Viva DTMF y viva la historia que trama y el viaje que te lleva desde sonidos caribeños a sonidos africanos y producción vanguardista. El mejor Benito.

> The layers— you don’t have to be fluent in Spanish to feel it. The sound alone took me on a journey, and I could recognize elements from salsa classics and the greats. Growing up surrounded by different flavors of Latin and Spanish music, it felt familiar yet new. You can tell it’s a mashup of cultures just from the sound itself. The live orchestra touches in the music brought such richness, just like this reggaeton beat. Bad Bunny really went back to his origins with this one—it’s rooted in so much tradition. I’m not even from the culture but as a mixed race Canadian with South American/ West Indian background oh I noticed and appreciate it. Sadly, the masses with limited  attention spans, lol  won’t see the genius of this album. The more it’s played and talked about then folks will take their time to see it & feel it.

> No puedes comparar la trayectoria de Dj/Productor con la de un cantante son diferentes tiempos, Cuando lanzaron Los Benjamins (Más Flow 3) allá por el 2005 Luny Tunes presentaron oficialmente a Tainy, Yankee, Wisin y Yandel ya llevaban como 15 años en el reggaetón (ósea a comienzos de los 90), digo agradezco el reconocimiento que le das a Tainy porque para mi es uno de mis mejores productores de Reggaetón por todos los tiempos junto con Dj Nelson, Dj Urba y Monserrate, Noriega, Luny Tunes , Diésel , Mr G, Eliel el que habla con las manos, Nesty, Víctor el Nazi, etc. Pero como tepito no lo puedes comparar con los cantantes porque como dice un comentario arriba es más desgaste para el cantante, sin embargo que viva el reggaetón por todos los tiempos y que nos dure el Grand Marcos Masis Aka Tainy ❤❤❤

> Te creo, se debe poner en el pedestal del género, pero debajo de Luny, Tunes, Nelly, Nesty, DJ Nelson. Tainy gana mayor reconocimiento ahora, gracias a que el género urbano explotó a nivel mundial, no únicamente en Latinoamérica. Además, este estilo de Reggaeton Latino (como la canción de DO), es el propio, con esa instrumental y arreglos musicales que se sienten latinos. A diferencia de otras producciones de Tainy, donde mezcla el reggaeton con géneros principalmente anglos, DnB/electrónica, como lo hizo en Data, que a mí parecer, poco tiene que ver con nuestra cultura latina. Cualquier canción de Tainy Tunes, su misma "Ven Pégate" de Sangre Nueva, me parece lejos mejor que cualquier neo reggaeton de Data.

El "hubiera" es para situasiones hipoteticas en el pasado que ya no pueden cambiarse, o sea literalmente tu caso... Ademas de que solo tienes que decirlo tu mismo para comprobar que suena raro si eso ya pasó, en cambio el "fuera" es para situaciones tambien hipoteticas pero en el futuro, o sea que no han sucedido. 

Otro error común que he visto en el internet es que dicen "musicas" y esa palabra literalmente no existe en el español, para eso está la palabra "canciones". Pero bueh, uno intenta ayudar y se ofenden como niñitas inmaduras, así que espero que ese no sea tu caso.

En la transición, el flow es homenaje a los coros altos con reverb de Tito El Bambino, Baby Rasta o incluso Yandel, y del 1:29 en adelante la pista es una combinación de diferentes canciones de 2002-2003, como "Si Estoy Fácil" de Héctor y Tito, y un par de elementos de "Es Mejor Olvidarlo" de Zion, Lennox y Baby Ranks.

> For the English ppls. This is old school reggaeton from the ‘90s-00’s. Straight from PR with a producer from the era, Tiny Tunes. This song samples a mixture of melodies from Hector y Tito’s ‘Si Estoy Fácil’ and ‘Baila Morena’. These melodies using synth pops, made popular by the legendary producers Luney Tunes, were very popular at the time and in my opinion the best era of reggaeton. Thank you #badbunny

When I was alive I would always pester him about how he reacts to persecution. He would listen to music when he was stressed out instead of taking it out on people or shooting up schools. I made fun of him for listening to Celine Dion

## 🎵 Yellow
**Artists:** Coldplay

### 1. @herdisul (3451 chars)

> Here is the full letter Chu sent Coldplay, via The Hollywood Reporter. (Warning: Beware of spoilers for Crazy Rich Asians.)

Dear Chris, Guy, Jonny and Will,

I know it's a bit strange, but my whole life I've had a complicated relationship with the color yellow. From being called the word in a derogatory way throughout grade school, to watching movies where they called cowardly people yellow, it's always had a negative connotation in my life. That is, until I heard your song. 

For the first time in my life, it described the color in the most beautiful, magical ways I had ever heard: the color of the stars, her skin, the love. It was an incredible image of attraction and aspiration that it made me rethink my own self image. 

I remember seeing the music video in college for the first time on TRL. That one shot with the sun rising was breathtaking for both my filmmaker and music-loving side. It immediately became an anthem for me and my friends and gave us a new sense of pride we never felt before...(even though it probably wasn't ever your intention). We could reclaim the color for ourselves and it has stuck with me for the majority of my life.

So the reason I am writing this now, is because I am directing a film for Warner Bros. called CRAZY RICH ASIANS (based on the best selling novel) and it is the first ALL-ASIAN cast for a Hollywood studio film in 25 years. Crazy. We were recently featured on the cover of Entertainment Weekly to commemorate the fact.

The story is a romantic comedy about a young Asian-American woman (played by Constance Wu) from New York coming to terms with her cultural identity while she's visiting her boyfriend's mother (played by Michelle Yeoh) in Singapore. It's a lavish, fun, romantic romp but underneath it all, there's an intimate story of a girl becoming a woman. Learning that she's good enough and deserves the world, no matter what she's been taught or how she's been treated, and ultimately that she can be proud of her mixed heritage.

The last scene of the movie shows this realization as she heads to the airport to return home a different woman. It's an empowering, emotional march and needs an anthem that lives up and beyond her inner triumph, which is where Yellow comes in. 

It would be such an honor to use your song that gave me so much strength throughout the years, to underscore this final part of our film. And for me personally, it would complete a journey that I've been going through, fighting to make it in the movie business.

I know as an artist it's always difficult to decide when it's ok to attach your art to someone else's--and I am sure in most instances you are inclined to say no. However, I do believe this project is special. I do believe this is a unique situation in which the first Hollywood studio film, with an All-Asian cast is not playing stereotypes or side-players, but romantic and comedic leads. It will give a whole generation of Asian-Americans, and others, the same sense of pride I got when I heard your song. I know it's recontextualized but I think that's what makes it powerful. I want all of them to have an anthem that makes them feel as beautiful as your words and melody made me feel when I needed it most.

Your consideration would mean so much to me and our project. 

I can show you the movie if you want to see the context, or talk to you if you have any questions. Thank you for taking the time to listen.

Much love,
Jon M. Chu

> Blue Moon 
Nah, to be honest Momo's interpretation of the song is very inaccurate, in my opinion and several others. (According to the internet.)
The song is about true love. Yellow  symbolizes "Brightness and Hope."
The first verse tell you The Singer loves everything about her.
The 2nd verse basically saids that He fell in love with her and wrote a song for her.
"I took my turn..."
He took a date with her. He thought it was the best thing he's done.
The next few, "I drew a line..." and "I swam across...." The Singer got rid of bad habits to make the relationship work. ("I drew a line.")
He powered through his insecurities to make this relationship work. ("I swam across")
"Your skin..."
Saying she's beautiful inside and out.
"I'd bleed myself dry.."
He's willing to make sacrifices for the relationship to work.
And the Last verse basically saids how everything is bright because of her.. And the relationship.
Where did I get this? The internet. I literally had to write down the meaning of this song for homework before I saw this.. :P I didn't waste my time..right?
P.S: Sorry if everything's jumbled up and not in the right order.

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow
I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called, "Yellow"
So then I took my turn
Oh, what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow
Your skin, oh yeah, your skin, and bones
Turn into something beautiful
And you know, you know I love you so
You know I love you so
I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh, what a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow
I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh, what a thing to do
And it was all yellow
And your skin, oh yeah, your skin, and bones
Turn into something beautiful
And you know, for you, I'd bleed myself dry
For you, I'd bleed myself dry
It's true

Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for-
Look how they shine for you

> I'll never forget the 8 hour drive I took with my brother as we headed from middle-Georgia to Florida to see my Grandfather one last time. We knew he wasn't long for this world and we were listening to songs and talking the whole trip, as we took his car since we attended the same college. At about 5 minutes out from my grandfathers house this song came on un-requested and totally random in the I-pod playlist and somehow it was perfect, all either my brother or I could do was stay silent as we drove those final moments looking at the road ahead of us staring out the windshield wondering what would happen next, listening to this song.   Turns out he would pass on that same day after we all came to his bedside and uniformly declared we didn't want him to hurt anymore, it was spiritual. It was the first time I ever saw someone pass, it probably wont be my last  but as long as I am alive I will remember that trip and this song. Thank you Coldplay.

> +MrFrattt87 There isn't anything grammatically wrong with it per se, it depends on which English you're using. The word 'gotten' is a past participle of the verb 'get' and dates back to the middle english ages (http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/gotten). Although not used much in British English, it is commonly used in American English.


So if following the grammar of British English the sentence should be written as "This song has got me through everything" - if the action has already ended or if it's something continuous - "This song gets me through everything".


As for the meaning of the sentence "This song has gotten me through everything", I would assume that the song has helped her go through a lot of difficult times as a form of motivation or comfort, something within those lines. 


Hope that helps. xD
