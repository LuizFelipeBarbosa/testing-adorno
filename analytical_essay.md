# The Algorithm as Culture Industry: Adorno's Critique in the Age of the "For You" Page

## (APA Citation Style)

---

Theodor Adorno died in 1969, decades before the first personal computer was manufactured or even the first recommendation algorithm was created. Yet, if one reads his critique of the "Culture Industry" today, it reads less like mid-century philosophy and more like a user manual for the TikTok "For You" page. On modern social media platforms, recommendation engines process raw user data---such as likes, views, and watch time---to build individual viewer profiles, allowing companies to predict user preferences, suggest relevant content, and sell products. However, through the lens of Theodor Adorno, this customized data is not proof of our individuality; rather, it enforces the "standardization" of our identity. It is the ultimate manifestation of "pseudo-individuality"---a system where the algorithm functions as an engine of "The Culture Industry," commodifying our media habits and selling our own conformity back to us as personal choice while we "passively" consume mass-produced slop.

This essay explores the premise that these recommendation engines have become the invisible curators of modern culture, fostering an uncritical consumption of media content. To do so, we will examine the extent to which Adorno's critiques of popular music are supported by real-world data. Through a quantitative analysis of user comments across 31 of the top-streamed songs in 2025, this paper demonstrates how digital engagement has largely standardized the listener's response rather than liberating it---while simultaneously enabling forms of discussion that Adorno's theory deemed impossible. Ultimately, the repetitive, identity-signaling nature of these comments over genuine musical critique confirms his theory of "regressive listening," revealing an audience that has become an echo chamber for the Culture Industry's own marketing.

## I. Standardization: The Algorithm's Template

In "On Popular Music," Adorno argues that the structure of popular music is "pre-given and pre-accepted, before the actual experience of the music starts" (Adorno, 1941, p. 17). Every element---verse, chorus, bridge---slots into a rigid template, making individual songs interchangeable units. The culture industry does not produce art; it produces variations on a formula.

An NLP analysis of 209,049 YouTube comments across the Top Tracks of 2025 Global Spotify playlist identified 69 comments classified under the "Standardization" critique label (average confidence 0.81), with the word "generic" recurring across artists and genres---suggesting listeners perceive a systemic condition, not isolated cases (Critique-Label Matched Comments, 2026). On "Espresso," @nellyravenhood, a self-described fan, concedes: "just this particular song, it sounds like a generic pop song for some reason" (nellyravenhood, 2024). On "Beautiful Things," @chrishughes1057 broadens the diagnosis: "It's just like every generic pop song being put out in the last 15 years" (chrishughes1057, 2024).

Adorno's concept gains new force when applied to the delivery mechanism itself. In "A Social Critique of Radio Music," he warns that radio atomizes the musical experience, severing listeners from "the structural wholeness of the work" (Adorno, 1945, p. 211). Today's algorithms---Spotify's Discover Weekly, YouTube's autoplay, TikTok's "For You" page---do not merely distribute standardized music; they standardize the *context* of listening. A song is encountered not as an artistic statement but as a fifteen-second TikTok snippet or background loop. @alex.profi27 captures this regarding "Espresso": "The video is amazing, the song: meah. Its giving tik tok music or elevator music" (alex.profi27, 2024). When the algorithm selects the next song, it is not curating taste---it is, in Adorno's terms, pre-giving the whole before experience begins.

## II. Pseudo-Individualization: Personalization as Conformity

Adorno defines pseudo-individualization as "endowing cultural mass production with the halo of free choice or open market on the basis of standardization itself" (Adorno, 1941, p. 25). The culture industry permits surface-level variation---a distinctive vocal timbre, a quirky aesthetic---precisely to disguise underlying sameness, granting listeners an illusion of personal taste.

The recommendation algorithm is pseudo-individualization at industrial scale. Spotify's "Made For You" playlists promise an experience tailored to unique preferences, but this "tailoring" draws from the same narrow pool of algorithmically favored tracks---the very 31 songs in this analysis, appearing on millions of personalized playlists simultaneously. Each listener believes they have discovered something personal; the algorithm has delivered the same commodity to everyone, dressed in the language of individual choice.

Commenters identify this mechanism with precision. On "Espresso," @WhispersOfWizdom offers a terse verdict: "It's giving manufactured personality" (WhispersOfWizdom, 2024)---a phrase that could serve as a dictionary definition of pseudo-individualization. @MeMe-pj8ve is blunter: "this singer is subpar, an industry plant, and DISAPPOINTING" (MeMe-pj8ve, 2024). The phrase "industry plant," applied across the dataset to Carpenter, Billie Eilish, Lola Young, and Kendrick Lamar, has become the vernacular term for what Adorno theorized: the perception that an artist's uniqueness is engineered by industrial machinery (Critique-Label Matched Comments, 2026). @Hoos extends this critique to the audience itself, accusing Kendrick Lamar of "making garbage music because he knows it will sell to this edgy younger generation who thinks they are 'different' and listening to 'art'" (Hoos, 2024)---identifying both halves of pseudo-individualization at once: the artist produces a false image of authenticity, and the listener consumes a false image of discernment.

The NLP pipeline flagged 51 comments under "Commodification / Market Logic" (average confidence 0.81), many centered on accusations of "payola"---paid playlist placement designed to simulate organic discovery (Critique-Label Matched Comments, 2026). When @alicaramba7680 writes, "If only music industry care about what listeners needs instead of buying faked success for countless cheap, banal and generic chicks" (alicaramba7680, 2023), we hear Adorno's core argument in raw form: the industry manufactures both the product *and* the demand for it.

## III. Regressive Listening: The Echo Chamber as Audience

Adorno's most provocative claim is not merely that popular music is standardized but that it produces standardized *listeners*. In "On Popular Music," he describes a mode of reception in which the listener's response is "pre-determined by the mechanism of popular music itself" (Adorno, 1941, p. 26). Recognition replaces cognition; comfort replaces challenge. The listener does not evaluate---the listener *recognizes*, and this recognition is experienced as pleasure.

The comment sections beneath these 31 songs offer powerful evidence for this thesis. Of 209,049 comments analyzed, only 208---a mere 0.1%---contained any identifiable engagement with the mechanisms of cultural production (Critique-Label Matched Comments, 2026). The overwhelming majority consist of precisely the kind of pre-programmed, identity-signaling responses Adorno predicted: "This slaps," "Who's here in 2026?", "I'm not crying, you're crying." These are not evaluations of music; they are performances of consumption---ritualistic declarations of belonging that mirror the standardized product they accompany.

YouTube's sorting algorithm compounds this effect, promoting comments with high engagement---typically the most generic, broadly relatable reactions---burying substantive critique beneath emojis and time-stamped affirmations. The comment section becomes an echo chamber mediated by the same algorithmic logic as the music itself. @julesvondaniken1792 links this directly to the commodity form: "no it's giving consumerism background music and 100% cheap polyester" (julesvondaniken1792, 2024). @Dr_Darrow is blunter: "another ordinary overprocessed pile of garbage got a bunch of listens from the mass of braindead ordinaries" (Dr_Darrow, 2026)---regressive listening rendered in the vernacular.

## IV. Point of Disagreement: The Critical Listener Adorno Denied

The strongest counter-argument to Adorno does not dispute that standardization, pseudo-individualization, and regressive listening exist. It challenges his conclusion about their *totality*. For Adorno, the culture industry's mechanisms are so pervasive that genuine critical consciousness becomes virtually impossible for the mass listener. In "On Popular Music," he insists that the listener's response is "pre-determined by the mechanism of popular music itself," leaving no room for autonomous judgment (Adorno, 1941, p. 26). Yet the very song that most neatly confirms Adorno's critique---"Espresso"---also produces the evidence that refutes it.

Beneath "Espresso," listeners do not merely consume; they actively construct meaning. @topfangirl14 writes: "it's giving vintage summer, it's giving teen beach movie, it's giving sharpay singing fabulus in hsm, it's giving top gun beach scene, SABRINA SERVED ONCE AGAIN" (topfangirl14, 2024). With 153,000 likes, this is not passive reception---it is intertextual reading, a listener weaving the song into a personal web of cultural references that no algorithm or producer scripted. @shredsilastv's comment, "the way she says 'I'm working late cause I'm a singer' is so satisfying" (shredsilastv, 2024), garnered 145,000 likes by isolating a specific moment of vocal delivery and articulating precisely *why* it works---the kind of micro-level aesthetic attention Adorno claimed mass listeners were incapable of. @EnriqueBicha evaluates the song across multiple dimensions: "Budget is budgeting, song on point, voice on point, choreo on point, she looks absolutely astonishing, hope this time she gets all the flowers she deserves" (EnriqueBicha, 2024)---a multi-criteria assessment of production, vocals, choreography, and aesthetics that Adorno reserved for the concert hall.

Perhaps most striking is the recurring pattern of listeners who defy their own social identity to enjoy the song. @truthseeking3818 writes: "33 year old male metal head and I love it" (truthseeking3818, 2024). @labamba4408 confesses: "The homies can NEVER know I was here" (labamba4408, 2024), a sentiment echoed by dozens of others---men who acknowledge that enjoying "Espresso" transgresses peer-group norms yet choose to consume and comment anyway. If the culture industry produces conformity, these listeners should consume what their demographic is *supposed* to consume or remain silent. Instead, they perform an act of autonomous taste---crossing genre and gender boundaries despite social pressure. @roxannemapache826 goes further, placing the song in historical context: "I'm 31 and from the era of 2010 pop music, and I will say, this song is so necessary for pop... we need bubblegum pop to return" (roxannemapache826, 2024). She does not passively accept what the algorithm delivers; she evaluates the song against a personal canon and articulates why this product fills a genre need.

Across the broader dataset, the NLP pipeline identified 208 such comments---listeners who independently articulate culture-industry critiques Adorno reserved for the theorist's privileged vantage point (Critique-Label Matched Comments, 2026). @takesallkindscomedy, on sombr's "back to friends," identifies standardization, pseudo-individualization, and commodification in a single observation: "It's intentionally 'nostalgic', it's music that's tailored to fit a fashion cycle trend... I wish I didn't know to be so cynical but it's just how the industry works" (takesallkindscomedy, 2026). @tomneal1789 extends Adorno's argument to vocal production: "the 'American Idoling' of pop music has turned voices so generic... Nowadays, it feels as though everyone goes to the same voice coach" (tomneal1789, 2026).

If the culture industry truly produces the total passivity Adorno claims, these comments should not exist. Their existence reveals that mass audiences are not the undifferentiated, regressed consumers he imagined but a heterogeneous population capable of recognizing industrial mechanisms, constructing independent meaning, and transgressing demographic programming---all while consuming the algorithm's products. The platform that circulates "Espresso" as a fifteen-second TikTok loop also hosts the critical discourse that dismantles its logic. Adorno could not have anticipated a media environment in which the consumer is simultaneously a commentator, a critic, and a broadcaster. The algorithm may be the new culture industry, but it has not yet managed to silence the 0.1%.
