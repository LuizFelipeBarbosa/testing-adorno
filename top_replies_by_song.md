> Lyrics:
Oohh
I
I just woke up from a dream
Where you and I had to say goodbye
And I don't know what it all means
But since I survived, I realized

Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night

If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you

Woo-ooh

Ooh, lost
Lost in the words that we scream
I don't even wanna do this anymore
'Cause you already know what you mean to me
And our love is the only war worth fighting for

Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night

If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you

Right next to you
Next to you
Right next to you
Oh-oh-oh

If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you

Ooh, ooh
I'd wanna be next to you

> My uncle passed away today, August 31st 2024, after a fight with Lewy body dementia. I got the chance to see him in the hospital a few weeks ago, and this was the last song we listened to together. It's already such a beautiful song, but it will now, forever, and always hold a deep meaning for me. He loved Bruno Mars. He was the kindest man I have ever known, even in his final days. I love you, uncle Craig. I know you're flying high up in heaven, free of pain, heart full of love. I'll see you again one day on the other side. 🕊️

Edit 1 year later: Thank you all so much, your comments are so kind! It took me a while to be able to come back here without crying, but reading this thread today is filling my heart. Sending my love and condolences to those who have lost loved ones, too. Their spirits will live on in us. ❤️‍🩹

### 23. @lavenderhexxic903 (80 replies)

> My mom use to buy all his songs on Apple Music. It confused me cause you can just listen for free literally anywhere. But her words were “I like to support him in this way. His music touches my soul.” And feel the same way but with Lady Gaga’s songs. My mom sadly passed due to metastatic breast cancer that came back in her bones. I was her only caretaker and she was all I had. She passed June 11th 2023 and I’m 19 now. This song came out and it hits me so close to home cause I wasn’t there when she passed. So yes I just wanted to hold her just for a while and for her to die with a smile. I feel like my mom sent me this song to tell I’ll be ok. Love you mom and love you Bruno and Gaga for this creating this song.❤

### 6. @FandomFlix (189 replies)

> Billie said in her last interview that contrary to popular belief, Birds of a Feather isn’t a happy song. In this video, she is being dragged by the absence of someone she loves. Even if it’s causing destruction shes blinded from the abuse and the effects of it. This is showing a vulnerable position where the result of loving someone who doesn’t want you anymore causes pain and destruction in your life like a domino effect. Beautiful song yet haunting.

EDIT: For those of you disappointed in it’s meaning, your postive perspective of this song is not invalid! Billie made this song to have duality so you can have your own narrative of it. This is why when she performs it in her current tour the video on the screens is a music video of her skipping through a sunny field collecting flowers. Her mind is incredible

> I lost my 14 year old daughter on August 14th of this year and every time I hear this song it makes me cry. I miss my daughter so much. I know she is an angel now, watching over me from far away. Baby, I miss you so much. You will always live in my heart.

My sweet daughter was bullied at school by other students, which led to severe depression and anxiety. My family taking her to multiple doctors and she took medication every day.but we didn’t see anything that getting better. Plus health insurance often wouldn’t cover the necessary treatments. 
I remember the morning of 8/14, I was getting ready for work, I spoke with my daughter and said, “Honey, Mom off to work now . I hope you have a great day at home. Call me if you need anything. Love you!” She replied, “love you too.”
That evening, when I returned home around 5:00pm.I knocked on her door and asked how was her day going so far. I called her name twice, but there was no response. When I opened the door, I found that she had taken her own life. I was paralyzed with shock, screaming and crying uncontrollably. I immediately called my husband, telling him that our baby girl was gone. He rushed home and called 911. I miss her everyday. I trying to find the answer why?

## 🎵 APT. - ROSÉ, Bruno Mars
**Artists:** ROSÉ, Bruno Mars

### 1. @paran_doksuri (893 replies)

> For anyone confused, "Apateu" is actually a Korean drinking game, and the name comes from the English word "apartment." The chorus rhythm is the same as the chant in the game where people shout, "apateu apateu, apateu apateu," before starting. So, there’s some clever wordplay with the lyrics "meet me at the apateu (apartment)." The intro is also a reference to the "Random Game," where the loser of the last round picks the next game to play, and in this case, Rosé chose to play "Apateu." I think she was trying to incorporate that fun and wild Korean drinking culture vibe and energy into the song

Since there were some people asking about the rule:
The way it works is, the leader picks a number, and then everyone stacks their hands in a pile. The person with their hand at the bottom moves it to the top and counts up from 1, all the way to the chosen number. Whoever ends up saying that number has to drink soju as a punishment.
You can catch Bruno Mars and Rosé playing the game at 0:49! (although it's not exactly the same as the real game)

And maybe the fall isn’t the end....it’s the start of your flight.

It felt like a soft reminder of what romance used to be… not performative, not loud, but intentional. Like someone brushing your hand on purpose, asking how you’ve been and really meaning it. It’s giving vintage seduction. That slow, teasing kind of intimacy where someone shows they’re into you through the smallest, most deliberate actions. I am here for it 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾

She’s not feeling up on him, dancing on him, or put in a position that labels her a “video girl”. It may not seem like a big detail to some, but it is to me. Most rappers tend to forget that women are artists that deserve tasteful features too, just vibing and doing their own thing. Cinematography was crispy too. Everyone looked beautiful in this. Classic song through and through.

Gracie Abrams

I could go and read your mind
Think about your dumb face all the time
Living in your glass house, I'm outside, uh
Looking into big blue eyes
Did it just to hurt me, make me cry
Smiling through it all, yeah, that's my life

You're an idiot, now I'm sure
Now I'm positive, I should go and warn her

Ooh, bet you're thinking: She's so cool
Kicking back on your couch, making eyes from across the room
Wait, I think I've been there too, ooh
What'd she do to get you off? (Uh-huh)
Taking down her hair, like, oh my God
Taking off your shirt, I did that once
Or twice, uh
No, I know, I know I'll fuck off (uh-huh)
But I think I like her, she's so fun
Wait, I think I hate her, I'm not that evolved, I'm sorry

She's missing it, sad, sad boy
Not my business, but I had to warn ya

Ooh, bet you're thinking: She's so cool
Kicking back on your couch, making eyes from across the room
Wait, I think I've been there too, ooh
Ooh, you've got me thinking: She's so cool
But I know what I know and you're just another dude
Ooh, that's so true, ooh

Made it out alive, but I think I lost it
Said that I was fine, said it from the coffin
Remember how I died when you started walking?
That's my life, that's my life

I'll put up a fight, taking out my earrings
Don't you know the vibe? Don't you know the feeling?
You should spend the night, catch me on your ceiling
That's your prize, that's your prize

Well, mm, bet you're thinking: She's so cool
Kicking back on your couch, making eyes from across the room
Wait, I think I've been there too, ooh
Ooh, you've got me thinking: She's so cool
But I know what I know and you're just another dude
Ooh, that's so true, ooh, ooh, oh

> [Verse 1]
Things fall apart
And time breaks your heart
I wasn't there but I know
She was your girl
You showed her the world
You fell out of love and you both let go

[Pre-Chorus]
She was cryin' in my shoulder
All I could do was hold her
Only made us closer
Until she lied
And I know that you love me
You don't need to remind me
I should put it all behind me
Shouldn't I?

[Chorus]
But I see her in the back of my mind
All the time
Like a fever
Like I'm burnin' alive by her side
Did I cross the line? Mm
Mm

Verse 2]
Well, good things don't last (Good things don't last)
And life moves so fast (Life moves so fast)
I'd never ask who was better
'Cause she couldn't be
More different from me
Happy and free in leather

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that you love me (You love me)
You don't need to remind me (Remind me)
Put it all behind me
But, baby

[Chorus]
I see her in the back of my mind (Back of my mind)
All the time (All the time)
Feels like a fever (Like a fever)
Like I'm burnin' alive (Burnin' alive) by her side
Did I cross the line? (Cross the line), oh

[Post-Chorus]
You say no one knows you so well
But every time you touch me, I just wonder I should feel
Valentines Day cryin' in the hotel
I know you didn't mean to hurt me, so I kept it to myself

Outro]
And I wonder
Do you see her in the back of your mind?
In my eyes
You say no one knows you so well
But every time you touch me, I just wonder I should feel
Valentines Day cryin' in the hotel
I know you didn't mean to hurt me, so I kept it to myself

> Lyrics:
I saw her in the rightest way
Looking like Anne Hathaway
Laughing while she hit her pen
And coughed, and coughed
And then, she came up to my knees
Begging, baby, would you please?
Do the things you said you'd do to me, to me
Oh, won't you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor?
And when you get a taste, can you tell me what's my flavor?
I don't believe in God, but I believe that you're my savior
My mom says that she's worried, but I'm covered in this favor
And when we're getting dirty, I forget all that is wrong
I sleep so I can see you 'cause I hate to wait so long
I sleep so I can see you and I hate to wait so long
She took my fingers to her mouth
The kind of thing that makes you proud
That nothing else had ever
Worked out, worked out
And lately, I've tried other things
But nothing can capture the sting
Of the venom, she's gonna spit out right now
Oh, won't you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor?
When you get a taste, can you tell me what's my flavor?
I don't believe in God, but I believe that you're my savior
I know that you've been worried, but the truth is in my favor
And when we're getting dirty, I forget all that is wrong
I sleep so I can see you 'cause I hate to wait so long
I sleep so I can see you and I hate to wait so long
And we can run away to the walls inside your house
I can be the cat, baby, you can be the mouse
And we can laugh off things that we know nothing about
We can go forever until you wanna sit it out

> "i could be hated by everyone if it meant being loved by you"
- I'm sorry I forgot the poem 😭🎀



"I love you" I tell her.
And I mean it.
"I love you too" She says.

At least that's what I think she said.

It was hard to hear her over the sound of the train bolting towards us.
-The train poem



"I'm sorry that you never got to post us.."
"I'm sorry that we never got to hold hands in public.."

"Hey hey don't apologize."

"No stop please just let me say this.."
"I love you. And I will scream it off the tallest tower."
"I will tell every person on the street. I love you."
"You have shown me love, the brightness, happiness.."

"Why are you saying all of this.."

"I will find you and love you in every universe."
"But.."

"But what.?"

"I can't love you in this one and I am so sorry.."

My world stopped.
As she stared at me, I saw regret..sadness..anger.
She didn't say anything.
I didn't either.

She turned around.
"I love you"
I couldn't even speak
But oh, how I wish I could've.

A few days later.
She died.
Suicide.
I sat on her grave once she was buried.

"I miss you, and I am so sorry I didn't say it back."
Tears were streaming. Into the soiled dirt.
And maybe she felt it.
That I loved her.

I took my phone out.
I took a selfie of us.
And at last, I could finally post us.

"I love you too my love. Forever."

The next day..where I cried..flowers bloomed..
And knew that was her saying..
"I know.."
- Bloom by WavesPoetryInc (wlw)

I never planned for this, I was planning her life for when I pass away, someday. God I miss her terribly, every sec of every day. It's been 8 days already and it feels like it's just been one long day, to me. This song was a song I used to sing to her, dont take away my beautiful things, well she is my everything in this life. I left the radio on in her room, like always. This song played a lot before, but it plays a ton now and I'm so thankful. When I hear it play, I run into her room and WE DANCE, JUST LIKE WE ALWAYS DID AND ALWAYS WILL. I MISS YOU SO MUCH MONKEY. THANK YOU FOR MAKING ALL OF OUR LIVES SO VERY BEAUTIFUL. YOU ARE MEMORABLE. I CANT WAIT TO CELEBRATE YOUR BEAUTIFUL LIFE. WHAT A BLESSING IT IS TO Be YOUR MAMA, thank you for loving all of us, the way that you do, but our love was and always will be, special. AT LEAST SHE IS FREE NOW,  free from it all down here.  I'LL SEE HER WHEN I GET THERE, FOR SURE. STAY SAFE AND ALWAYS BLESSED, EVERYONE. CHERISH THE SIMPLE THINGS, Before  THEY ARE GONE, IM SO GLAD I DID. WE LOVE YOU BABY, FLY HIGH MY ANGEL, MY ALL, MY EVERYTHING. LOVE MAMA AND ALL OF US. 😇 🐵 😎❤🙏 🎶

We just wanted to say thank you to all of the beautiful ppl who commented on our post. Your words and love and support mean the world to us and thank you for taking the time out of your life, to read and comment on a piece of ours. We are so grateful and so blessed!! We are wishing you all much love and many blessings in your life and i hope that some how this brings you comfort during a time of uncertainty. They want us to smile when we think of them and to be happy. Do the things that make them proud and yourself too. We will see them again, but right now, we must complete our mission down here, before we get to be with them again, up there. It's only a matter of time, so make a difference while you still can. Stay safe and always blessed and thank you again, for all of the BEAUTIFUL THINGS, you said and did ❤🙏😇 sorry to everyone who has lost someone, just hang in there, its going to be ok ☺️

> Verse 1]
For a while there it was rough
But lately, I've been doin' better
Than the last four cold Decembers I recall
And I see my family every month
I found a girl my parents love
She'll come and stay the night, and I think I might have it all
And I thank God every day
For the girl he sent my way
But I know the things he gives me, he can take away
And I hold you every night
And that's a feeling I wanna get used to
But there's no man as terrified as the man who stands to lose you

Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I hope I don't losе you
Mm
Please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
Don't take
Thеse beautiful things that I've got

[Chorus]
Please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
Don't take
These beautiful things that I've got

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, please
Please don't take

[Verse 2]
I found my mind, I'm feelin' sane
It's been a while, but I'm finding my faith
If everything's good and it's great, why do I sit and wait 'til it's gone?
Oh, I'll tell ya, I know I've got enough
I've got peace and I've got love
But I'm up at night thinkin' I just might lose it all

Chorus]

I felt every single word of it hit me to my core. It Brings tears to my eyes everytime I hear it. My children are my beautiful things and I just pray everyday to God that he doesn't take them away Because I'm barely finding my way and I don't think I can take another heart break.

Edit: This is a direct quote from Lola, about Messy: "Messy is an ADHD anthem, it really showcases everything I felt during my last relationship, but also it is deeper than that, as it talks about how I feel about myself in general — being too messy one day and too clean another, struggling to find that balance in myself." That makes so much sense. 💜

I stayed for 8 wasted years and finally left when I believed that he was going to kill me during his violent fits of rage. The sad fact is that narcissistic abuse can and will cause physical brain damage, and leave you susceptible to illness and disease, slowly killing you. As a survivor who is on my healing journey, I want you all to know that you are worthy of love and respect. One love y'all.

Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you

This maybe the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
This maybe the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword
Bring a morgue, but you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence and calculated promises all in your conversation

I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story, you endorsing?
Motherfucker, I don't even like you
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage, who I'm building with
I want the credit if I'm losing or I'm winning
On my momma that's the realest shit

Girl, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you

This maybe the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
This maybe the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

Skin covered in ego
Get to talkin', I get involved, like a rebound
No control, no off switch in the way that you bringing me down
It's a turn on, get it away from me
Know you mean wrong, keep away from me
And it's all wrong, get it away from me, yeah
I just cry for no reason, I just pray for no reason
I just thank for the life, for the day, for the hours and another life breathin'
I did it all 'cause it feel good
You live it all if you feel bad
Better live your life
We are running out of time

Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you

This maybe the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
This maybe the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

> My wife recently passed away after a long battle with cancer. This song just encapsulates my sadness. Takes me back to that night almost 10 years ago when we met for the first time. A magical night that we did not want to end. We were eventually asked to leave the restaurant since it was so late. We wandered around and sat on a bench and talked for hours. I will never forget that night we met. The Chorus sums up 100% what I went through with our cancer journey.. "I had ALL and then MOST of you. SOME and now NONE of you.. I dont know what I am supposed to do haunted by the ghost of you" . We both loved this song before but it now has a new added , layered meaning. She gave me so much least of all my greatest blessing our 6 year old daughter and I will forever see Jo in her.

> Lyrics: 
Something's got a hold of me lately
No, I don't know myself anymore
Feels like the walls are all closing in
And the devil's knocking at my door, whoa
Outta my mind, how many times
Did I tell you I'm no good at being alone?
Yeah, it's taking a toll on me, trying my best to keep
From tearing the skin off my bones, don't you know
I lose control
When you're not next to me
I'm falling apart right in front of you
Can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not next to me
Yeah, you're breaking my heart, baby
You make a mess of me
Problematic, problem is
I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit
Bad habit's hard to break when I'm with you
Yeah, I know, I could do it on my own, but I want
That real full moon black magic and it takes two
Problematic, problem is
When I'm with you I'm an addict
And I need some relief, my skin in your teeth
Can't see the forest through the trees
Got me down on my knees, darling please, oh
I lose control
When you're not next to me
I'm falling apart right in front of you
Can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not next to me
Yeah, you're breaking my heart, baby
You make a mess of me, yeah
I lose control
When you're not here with me
I'm falling apart right in front of you
Can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not here with me
Yeah, you're breaking my heart, baby
You make a mess of me

I found out last year he got married to his old high school girlfriend and then ended his own life a year later.

> I still remember the girl i've spent my middle school life with in japan.  We were friends since elementary, but the countless times I've called her 'my angel' 'sweetheart' was unforgettable. I always said those words in unserious manner but it was just a cover up to not make things awkward. I really liked her, her short hair and soft demeanor was so beautiful. I 'happened' to like androgynous looking boys with similar atmosphere as hers after I had to change school and got separated from her. However, I always got uncomfortable whenever I date those men like her and their 'male' side appeared, I didn't know why. I'm Japanese, so same-sex romance is forbidden, I didn't even know it existed until 2 years ago. Now I know who I am. 
Dear Chihiro, if you happened to be in same shoe as me and reading this, I loved you and I still do. I know that you were diligent young child and was interested in studying english. I hope you are here.

> Lyrics

I wanna be your vacuum cleaner
Breathing in your dust
I wanna be your Ford Cortina
I will never rust

If you like your coffee hot
Let me be your coffee pot
You call the shots, babe
I just wanna be yours

Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours
I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours

Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours

Let me be your leccy meter
And I'll never run out
Let me be the portable heater
That you'll get cold without

I wanna be your setting lotion (wanna be)
Hold your hair in deep devotion (I'll be)
At least as deep as the Pacific Ocean
Now I wanna be yours

Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours
I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours

Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
(Wanna be yours)

I wanna be your vacuum cleaner (wanna be yours)
Breathing in your dust (wanna be yours)
I wanna be your Ford Cortina (wanna be yours)
I will never rust (wanna be yours)

I just wanna be yours (wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (wanna be yours)

Thank me later:yougotthis: but just leave a like

This song samples a mixture of melodies from Hector y Tito’s ‘Si Estoy Fácil’ and ‘Baila Morena’. These melodies using synth pops, made popular by the legendary producers Luney Tunes, were very popular at the time and in my opinion the best era of reggaeton. Thank you #badbunny

The world, it’s people, music, everything is and always has been Yellow. One of the greatest songs ever made, yellow, it’s about our yellow world and a relationship that we all dream to be in. Yellow speaks to the heart, yellow is the color that ties everything together, it’s just yellow. Never forget this line, Look at the stars, look how they shine for you, and everything you do yeah they were all yellow. Live by that lyric and that lyric alone because yellow truly is the color of hopes and dreams. Live Yellow everyone!
