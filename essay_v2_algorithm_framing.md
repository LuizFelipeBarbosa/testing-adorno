# The Algorithm as Culture Industry: Adorno's Critique in the Age of the "For You" Page

## (APA Citation Style)

---

Theodor Adorno died in 1969, decades before the first personal computer was manufactured or even the first recommendation algorithm was created. Yet, if one reads his critique of the "Culture Industry" today, it reads less like mid-century philosophy and more like a user manual for the TikTok "For You" page. On modern social media platforms, recommendation engines process raw user data---such as likes, views, and watch time---to build individual viewer profiles, allowing companies to predict user preferences, suggest relevant content, and sell products. However, through the lens of Theodor Adorno, this customized data is not proof of our individuality; rather, it enforces the "standardization" of our identity. It is the ultimate manifestation of "pseudo-individuality"---a system where the algorithm functions as an engine of "The Culture Industry," commodifying our media habits and selling our own conformity back to us as personal choice while we "passively" consume mass-produced slop.

This essay explores the premise that these recommendation engines have become the invisible curators of modern culture, fostering an uncritical consumption of media content. To do so, we will examine the extent to which Adorno's critiques of popular music are supported by real-world data. Through a quantitative analysis of user comments across 31 of the top-streamed songs in 2025, this paper demonstrates how digital engagement has largely standardized the listener's response rather than liberating it---while simultaneously enabling forms of discussion that Adorno's theory deemed impossible. Ultimately, the repetitive, identity-signaling nature of these comments over genuine musical critique confirms his theory of "regressive listening," revealing an audience that has become an echo chamber for the Culture Industry's own marketing.

## I. Standardization: The Algorithm's Template

In "On Popular Music," Adorno argues that the structure of popular music is "pre-given and pre-accepted, before the actual experience of the music starts" (Adorno, 1941, p. 17). Every element---verse, chorus, bridge---slots into a rigid template, making individual songs interchangeable units within an undifferentiated mass of product. The culture industry does not produce art; it produces variations on a formula.

The 31 tracks on the Top Tracks of 2025 Global Spotify playlist bear this out with striking uniformity. An NLP analysis of 209,049 YouTube comments across all 31 songs identified 69 comments classified under the "Standardization" critique label, with an average confidence score of 0.81 (Critique-Label Matched Comments, 2026). What is remarkable is not merely that the word "generic" appears---it is that it appears *across* artists and genres, suggesting listeners perceive a systemic condition rather than isolated cases. On Sabrina Carpenter's "Espresso," @nellyravenhood, a self-described fan, concedes: "just this particular song, it sounds like a generic pop song for some reason" (nellyravenhood, 2024). On Benson Boone's "Beautiful Things," @chrishughes1057 broadens the diagnosis: "It's just like every generic pop song being put out in the last 15 years... its pretty ordinary" (chrishughes1057, 2024). On Coldplay's "Yellow," @Gino565 writes simply: "They got old years ago. Generic radio drivel now" (Gino565, 2021).

But Adorno's concept gains new force when applied to the delivery mechanism itself. In "A Social Critique of Radio Music," Adorno warns that radio atomizes the musical experience, severing listeners from "the structural wholeness of the work" and reducing it to isolated fragments (Adorno, 1945, p. 211). Today's recommendation algorithms---Spotify's Discover Weekly, YouTube's autoplay, TikTok's "For You" page---do not merely distribute standardized music; they standardize the *context* of listening. A song is not encountered as a complete artistic statement but as a fifteen-second TikTok snippet, a playlist transition, a background loop. @alex.profi27 captures this perfectly regarding "Espresso": "The video is amazing, the song: meah. Its giving tik tok music or elevator music" (alex.profi27, 2024). When the algorithm selects the next song for you, it is not curating your taste---it is, in Adorno's terms, pre-giving the whole before the experience begins.

## II. Pseudo-Individualization: Personalization as Conformity

Adorno defines pseudo-individualization as "endowing cultural mass production with the halo of free choice or open market on the basis of standardization itself" (Adorno, 1941, p. 25). The culture industry permits surface-level variation---a distinctive vocal timbre, a quirky aesthetic---precisely to disguise the underlying sameness of its products, granting the listener an illusion of meaningful personal taste.

The recommendation algorithm is pseudo-individualization at industrial scale. Spotify's "Made For You" playlists promise a listening experience tailored to your unique preferences. In practice, this "tailoring" draws from the same narrow pool of algorithmically favored tracks---the very 31 songs in this analysis, which appear on millions of personalized playlists simultaneously. Each listener believes they have discovered something personal; in reality, the algorithm has delivered the same commodity to everyone, dressed in the language of individual choice.

Commenters identify this mechanism with precision, even without the theoretical vocabulary. On "Espresso," @WhispersOfWizdom offers a terse verdict: "It's giving manufactured personality" (WhispersOfWizdom, 2024)---a phrase that could serve as a dictionary definition of pseudo-individualization. @MeMe-pj8ve is blunter: "this singer is subpar, an industry plant, and DISAPPOINTING" (MeMe-pj8ve, 2024). The phrase "industry plant," which appeared across the dataset in connection with Carpenter, Billie Eilish, Lola Young, Gigi Perez, and Kendrick Lamar (Critique-Label Matched Comments, 2026), has become the vernacular term for what Adorno theorized: the perception that an artist's apparent uniqueness is engineered by the machinery of the industry. @Hoos extends this critique to the audience itself, accusing Kendrick Lamar of "making garbage music because he knows it will sell to this edgy younger generation who thinks they are 'different' and listening to 'art'" (Hoos, 2024). This comment identifies both halves of pseudo-individualization: the artist produces a false image of authenticity, and the listener consumes a false image of discernment.

The broader data reinforces this pattern. The NLP pipeline flagged 51 comments under "Commodification / Market Logic" (average confidence 0.81), many of which centered on the term "industry plant" and accusations of "payola"---paid playlist placement designed to simulate organic discovery (Critique-Label Matched Comments, 2026). When @alicaramba7680 writes, "If only music industry care about what listeners needs instead of buying faked success for countless cheap, banal and generic chicks waving their butts and legs" (alicaramba7680, 2023), we hear a commenter articulating, in raw form, the core of Adorno's argument: that the industry manufactures both the product *and* the demand for it.

## III. Regressive Listening: The Echo Chamber as Audience

Adorno's most provocative claim is not merely that popular music is standardized but that it produces standardized *listeners*. In "On Popular Music," he describes a mode of reception in which the listener's response is "pre-determined by the mechanism of popular music itself" (Adorno, 1941, p. 26). Recognition replaces cognition; comfort replaces challenge. The listener does not evaluate---the listener *recognizes*, and this recognition is experienced as pleasure.

The comment sections beneath these 31 songs offer powerful evidence for this thesis. Of 209,049 comments analyzed, only 208---a mere 0.1%---contained any identifiable engagement with the mechanisms of cultural production (Critique-Label Matched Comments, 2026). The overwhelming majority consist of precisely the kind of pre-programmed, identity-signaling responses Adorno predicted: "This slaps," "Who's here in 2026?", "I'm not crying, you're crying." These are not evaluations of music; they are performances of consumption---ritualistic declarations of belonging that mirror the standardized product they accompany.

The comment section, mediated by the same algorithmic logic as the music itself, becomes an echo chamber. YouTube's sorting algorithm promotes comments with high engagement---typically the most generic, broadly relatable reactions---burying substantive critique beneath a wall of emojis and time-stamped affirmations. @julesvondaniken1792 links this phenomenon directly to the commodity form: "no it's giving consumerism background music and 100% cheap polyester" (julesvondaniken1792, 2024). @Dr_Darrow is more explicit: "another ordinary overprocessed pile of garbage got a bunch of listens from the mass of braindead ordinaries" (Dr_Darrow, 2026). This is the language of regressive listening rendered in the vernacular---the accusation that audiences have been conditioned into passivity by the very infrastructure they mistake for liberation.

## IV. Point of Disagreement: The Critical Listener Adorno Denied

The strongest counter-argument to Adorno does not dispute that standardization, pseudo-individualization, and regressive listening exist. It challenges his conclusion about their *totality*. For Adorno, the culture industry's mechanisms are so pervasive that genuine critical consciousness becomes virtually impossible for the mass listener. Yet the very data that confirms his critique also refutes this claim.

The 208 critique-bearing comments---the 0.1%---represent something Adorno's framework cannot accommodate: ordinary listeners who independently articulate precisely the kinds of culture-industry analysis that he reserved for the theorist's privileged vantage point. Consider @takesallkindscomedy's remarkable comment on sombr's "back to friends":

> It's intentionally 'nostalgic', it's music that's tailored to fit a fashion cycle trend... I wish I didn't know to be so cynical but it's just how the industry works. I wouldn't be remotely surprised if the label used WGSN focus groups. (takesallkindscomedy, 2026)

This commenter, without any evident exposure to Frankfurt School theory, identifies standardization (recycled chord progressions), pseudo-individualization (manufactured nostalgia as brand strategy), and commodification (music "tailored" to market research) in a single observation. Or consider @tomneal1789 on Benson Boone: "the 'American Idoling' of pop music has turned voices so generic... voices with imperfections and idiosyncrasies that made them instantly recognizable and unique. Nowadays, it feels as though everyone goes to the same voice coach" (tomneal1789, 2026). This is Adorno's argument about standardization extended to vocal production---a refinement the theorist himself might have appreciated.

If the culture industry truly produces the total passivity Adorno claims, these comments should not exist. Their existence reveals that mass audiences are not the undifferentiated, regressed consumers he imagined but a heterogeneous population containing individuals capable of recognizing and articulating the mechanisms of cultural production---even while consuming its products. The very platforms that deliver "Espresso" as a fifteen-second TikTok loop also host the critical discourse that dismantles its logic. Writing in the 1940s, Adorno could not have anticipated a media environment in which the consumer is simultaneously a commentator, a critic, and a broadcaster---nor one in which the tools of mass distribution would also function as platforms for the critical exchange he believed only serious art could provoke. The algorithm may be the new culture industry, but it has not yet managed to silence the 0.1%.
