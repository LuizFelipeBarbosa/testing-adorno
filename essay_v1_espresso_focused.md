# Analytical Essay: Adorno's Culture Industry Critique and Sabrina Carpenter's "Espresso"

## (APA Citation Style)

---

**Thesis:** Sabrina Carpenter's "Espresso" (2024) validates three central pillars of Theodor Adorno's critique of popular music---standardization, pseudo-individualization, and regressive listening---as the song's formulaic structure, manufactured artistic persona, and reduction to passive background consumption confirm that the culture industry remains a powerful engine of aesthetic conformity. However, Adorno's framework cannot account for the sophisticated, self-aware critique that ordinary listeners themselves articulate in response to these very mechanisms, revealing a capacity for critical consciousness among mass audiences that his theory systematically denies.

## Points of Agreement

### 1. Standardization: The Pre-Given Whole

In "On Popular Music," Adorno argues that popular music is governed by rigid structural schemas in which "the whole is pre-given and pre-accepted, before the actual experience of the music starts" (Adorno, 1941, p. 17). Every element---verse, chorus, bridge---is interchangeable within a narrow template, such that individual songs function as fungible units in an undifferentiated mass of product. The culture industry does not produce works of art; it produces variations on a formula.

"Espresso" exemplifies this standardization with striking clarity. The song follows a conventional verse-pre-chorus-chorus structure built on a four-chord loop, a mid-tempo groove indebted to disco-pop and funk bass lines that have recurred across decades of Top 40 production. YouTube commenter @nellyravenhood, a self-described fan of Carpenter's broader catalog, nonetheless observes that "just this particular song, it sounds like a generic pop song for some reason" (nellyravenhood, 2024). More pointedly, @deepaligham notes that "this sounds like say so. She copied the same beats" (deepaligham, 2024), identifying the specific mechanism of recycling that Adorno describes: producers draw from a finite palette of harmonic and rhythmic templates, generating songs that are formally interchangeable beneath superficial sonic differences.

An NLP analysis of over 209,000 YouTube comments on the Top Tracks of 2025 Global playlist found that 69 comments were classified under the "Standardization" critique label with an average confidence of 0.81 (Critique-Label Matched Comments, 2026). The term "generic" recurs across songs and artists, suggesting that listeners perceive not merely an individual case of formula but a systemic condition---precisely the industry-wide homogenization Adorno diagnosed. As @chrishughes1057 writes of another song on the same playlist, "It's just like every generic pop song being put out in the last 15 years" (chrishughes1057, 2024). Adorno's concept of standardization, then, is not merely a theoretical abstraction; it names a phenomenon that listeners themselves identify and articulate with remarkable frequency.

### 2. Pseudo-Individualization: The Manufactured Persona

Adorno defines pseudo-individualization as "endowing cultural mass production with the halo of free choice or open market on the basis of standardization itself" (Adorno, 1941, p. 25). The culture industry permits surface-level variation---a distinctive vocal timbre, a quirky aesthetic, a playful lyrical persona---precisely to disguise the underlying sameness of its products. The listener is given the impression of meaningful diversity and personal taste, when in fact every choice leads back to the same standardized commodity.

Sabrina Carpenter's public image is a case study in this mechanism. Her persona---witty, self-deprecating, vaguely retro, casually provocative---is carefully curated to distinguish her in a crowded pop marketplace. Yet commenters see through this branding with Adornoian precision. @WhispersOfWizdom's terse assessment, "It's giving manufactured personality" (WhispersOfWizdom, 2024), directly identifies the simulation of individuality that Adorno theorized. @MeMe-pj8ve goes further: "this singer is subpar, an industry plant, and DISAPPOINTING" (MeMe-pj8ve, 2024). The phrase "industry plant" has become vernacular shorthand for pseudo-individualization---the perception that an artist's apparent uniqueness and grassroots ascent are, in fact, engineered by labels and management teams. Across the broader dataset, the term "industry plant" appeared in connection with multiple artists including Carpenter, Billie Eilish, Lola Young, and Gigi Perez, applied by the NLP pipeline's "Commodification / Market Logic" category (51 hits, average confidence 0.81) (Critique-Label Matched Comments, 2026).

@alicaramba7680 broadens the critique beyond any single artist: "If only music industry care about what listeners needs instead of buying faked success for countless cheap, banal and generic chicks waving their butts and legs" (alicaramba7680, 2023). This comment captures the intersection of standardization and pseudo-individualization that Adorno considered inseparable: a parade of apparently distinct artists who are, underneath the branding, interchangeable products of the same industrial process.

### 3. Regressive Listening: Music as Background Noise

In "On the Fetish-Character in Music and the Regression of Listening," Adorno argues that mass-produced music trains its audience toward a mode of reception he calls "regressive listening," in which "recognition replaces cognition" and listeners respond to "isolated, pre-digested stimuli" rather than apprehending a musical work as an integrated whole (Adorno, 1938, p. 46). The culture industry does not merely produce standardized music; it produces standardized listeners, conditioned to consume passively and uncritically.

"Espresso" circulated primarily through TikTok clips and streaming playlists---delivery mechanisms that structurally encourage the fragmented, distracted mode of listening Adorno described. Multiple commenters explicitly frame the song in terms of passive background consumption. @julesvondaniken1792 writes: "no it's giving consumerism background music and 100% cheap polyester" (julesvondaniken1792, 2024)---a remarkable formulation that links the song's sonic texture to the commodity form itself. @alex.profi27 concurs: "The video is amazing, the song: meah. Its giving tik tok music or elevator music" (alex.profi27, 2024). The label "elevator music" is especially revealing. It positions "Espresso" not as an object of aesthetic attention but as ambient filler, music designed not to be listened to but merely to be present---the sonic equivalent of wallpaper.

In "A Social Critique of Radio Music," Adorno warns that radio transforms the musical experience into a distracted, atomized encounter with sonic fragments, severing the listener from the structural wholeness of the work (Adorno, 1945, p. 211). The contemporary equivalent---a fifteen-second TikTok snippet looping beneath a dance trend---intensifies this fragmentation to an extreme Adorno could scarcely have imagined. When @Dr_Darrow describes how another song on the same playlist gained traction because the artist "kept pushing until [it] was heard by enough of the ordinaries, and another ordinary overprocessed pile of garbage got a bunch of listens from the mass of braindead ordinaries" (Dr_Darrow, 2026), the language of mass conditioning and intellectual regression maps almost perfectly onto Adorno's framework.

## Point of Disagreement: The Critical Listener Adorno Denied

The strongest counter-argument to Adorno's critique does not dispute that standardization, pseudo-individualization, and regressive listening exist. Rather, it challenges Adorno's conclusion about their totalizing effect on audiences. For Adorno, the culture industry's mechanisms are so pervasive and so effective that genuine critical consciousness becomes virtually impossible for the mass listener. In "On Popular Music," he writes that the listener's response is "pre-determined by the mechanism of popular music itself," leaving no space for autonomous judgment (Adorno, 1941, p. 26). The masses, in his account, are entirely captured.

The evidence from over 209,000 YouTube comments on the Top Tracks of 2025 Global playlist powerfully contradicts this claim. The NLP pipeline identified 208 comments---across six distinct critique categories---in which ordinary listeners independently articulate precisely the kinds of culture-industry critique that Adorno reserved for the theorist's privileged perspective (Critique-Label Matched Comments, 2026). These are not academics or cultural critics. They are YouTube commenters who, without any apparent exposure to Frankfurt School theory, identify the same mechanisms Adorno described: the recycling of chord progressions, the manufacturing of artistic personas, the reduction of music to market metrics, and the conditioning of audiences toward passive consumption.

Consider @takesallkindscomedy's extraordinary comment on the song "back to friends" by sombr: "It's intentionally 'nostalgic', it's music that's tailored to fit a fashion cycle trend... I wish I didn't know to be so cynical but it's just how the industry works. I wouldn't be remotely surprised if the label used WGSN focus groups" (takesallkindscomedy, 2026). This commenter identifies standardization (recycled chord progressions), pseudo-individualization (manufactured nostalgia as a branding device), and commodification (music "tailored" to "fashion cycle trends" via market research) in a single, unprompted observation. Or consider @tomneal1789 on Benson Boone's "Beautiful Things": "the 'American Idoling' of pop music has turned voices so generic... voices with imperfections and idiosyncrasies that made them instantly recognizable and unique. Nowadays, it feels as though everyone goes to the same voice coach" (tomneal1789, 2026). This is a critique of standardization at the level of vocal production---a refinement of Adorno's argument that the theorist himself might have appreciated.

Adorno's framework has no adequate space for these voices. If the culture industry truly produces the total passivity he claims, then these comments should not exist. Their existence suggests that mass audiences are not the undifferentiated, regressed consumers Adorno imagined but rather a heterogeneous population containing individuals fully capable of recognizing and resisting the mechanisms of cultural production---even while consuming its products. The very platform that delivers "Espresso" as a fifteen-second TikTok loop also hosts the critical discourse that dismantles its logic. This dialectic---consumption and critique coexisting in the same space, often in the same person---is something Adorno's binary of autonomous art versus mass culture cannot accommodate. Writing in the 1940s, he could not have anticipated a media environment in which the consumer is simultaneously a commentator, a critic, and a broadcaster, nor one in which the tools of mass distribution (YouTube, TikTok, Spotify) would also function as platforms for the kind of critical exchange he believed only serious art could provoke.
