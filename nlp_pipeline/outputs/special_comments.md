🎵 **Song:** back to friends — sombr

> Because it’s roughly the same chord progression and tempo of indie-ish breakthrough pop from 2010. MGMT kinda, but think more like Gotye (“now you’re just somebody that I used to know”). It’s intentionally ‘nostalgic’, it’s music that’s tailored to fit a fashion cycle trend of 2010s “indie” soft-rock/pop/punkish dance pop imitations. I wish I didn’t know to be so cynical but it’s just how the industry works. I wouldn’t be remotely surprised if the label used WGSN focus groups etc. It’s a good song, but in 2009-2013ish we had the real deal, and it was much more adventurous, varied…a wave of music that was accessibly poppy but idiosyncratic, kind of melancholy and semi cerebral, guitar/voices/synth driven. You got Vampire Weekend, Santigold, MGMT, Silversun Pickups, and IMO the greatest band still at it, Animal Collective (tho AC is much more left-field and avant). And yeah innumerable more

I went to college when that stuff was big, there’s so much great stuff that you might faintly even recognize but not know how to place it, assuming you’re the younger age bracket. I’ll post a playlist I made a while back of that era/set of sounds if you’re interested in something like this with a lil more wild at heart

🎵 **Song:** Love Me Not — Ravyn Lenae

> The reason why it's nostalgic for us and has a great sound is it's reminiscent of Bob dylans sons band. The wall flowers hit "one head light". Like most songs, it has the same chord progression, which is a really satisfying vibe of an earworm.  Great job on this track and bringing this tune back around.

A popular Western Pop artists has a song with 500 million + views and only has 83k comments, meaning that’s most people are just here to enjoy music, while GENERIC and DEGENERATE k pop songs git like fucking nearly 200K comments for a crap song that ain’t even reached 100 million vies yet, shows that generic K pop is anything but music

🎵 **Song:** Beautiful Things — Benson Boone

> Incredible voice, but let's be honest, the "American Idoling" of pop music has turned voices so generic.   Once upon a time, under the wide. umbrella of pop, you had voices as diverse as Price, Cyndi Lauper, Elton John, George Michael, Sting, Billy Idol, Janet Jackson, Madonna, Boy George, The Cure, the list goes on.  Raspy voices, gruff voices, singsongy voices, melancholy voices, exuberant voices...voices with imperfections and idiosyncrasies that  made them instantly recognizable and unique.  Nowadays, it feels as thought everyone goes to the same voice coach, unique voices are buried in anonymity...

🎵 **Song:** Die With A Smile — Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars

> Genuinely curious - what part of the lyrics of THIS song do you find to be standout in some way? Don't get me wrong, I found it to be an enjoyable pop song, but it didn't strike me as special or groundbreaking in any way; particularly lyrically. Half of the lyrics are tropes from pop songs of the last 40 years that have been previously written in some form or another and used countless times in other songs already. It's just a very generic "I love you so much that here's a list of things that could happen and I'd want to be with you" love song. shrug

🎵 **Song:** back to friends — sombr

> YES!! It's a perfectly written verse, chorus and bridge template song, just like the kind that richly blessed the developmental years of rock and roll. It's almost like the excesses of the hippie era never happened. Sombr is an example of a great renaissance that is going on in music at the moment. We have another chance to get seriously blessed. Glad to see you are seizing that opportunity!

> The songs in this movie in no way sounds better than disney classic hits like "let it go","under the sea" and "you'll be in my heart"etc. to name a few which are actually singable. This song will be forgotten in a year given how none of the melody or production stands out. Many disney classic remains iconic to this day so I don't see how any of the tracks fare better than disney's best. Plus it sounds super generic, fake and so not kpop.

> 100% agree. also what do you meeaannn, some of us loved it especially BECAUSE of its "strong Korean flavour" as you say 😆🩷
When a real effort is made to share a cultural experience, and express that in one's art, it truly connects!
thats where Disney has been failing recently, imo. it fails to connect because its all so generic and... rinsed (eg. Snow White, Little Mermaid, Lion King and Lilo & Stitch live actions, Wish, etc) with the exception of Encanto, in their recent list. they're more afraid of hurting sentiments than concerned about telling an actual STORY

> ​@ I dont F with Drake or could even name a track hes done in the last 10 years. I also lost more respect for Kendrick when he even showed Drake any interest or the light of day. Like why would Kendrick think he has to prove he is better than an industry plant Jew. Kendrick is also now a sellout making garbage music because he knows it will sell to this edgy younger generation who thinks they are "different" and listening to "art". Its all whack af.
