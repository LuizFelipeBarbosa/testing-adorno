🎵 **Song:** back to friends — sombr

> Because it’s roughly the same chord progression and tempo of indie-ish breakthrough pop from 2010. MGMT kinda, but think more like Gotye (“now you’re just somebody that I used to know”). It’s intentionally ‘nostalgic’, it’s music that’s tailored to fit a fashion cycle trend of 2010s “indie” soft-rock/pop/punkish dance pop imitations. I wish I didn’t know to be so cynical but it’s just how the industry works. I wouldn’t be remotely surprised if the label used WGSN focus groups etc. It’s a good song, but in 2009-2013ish we had the real deal, and it was much more adventurous, varied…a wave of music that was accessibly poppy but idiosyncratic, kind of melancholy and semi cerebral, guitar/voices/synth driven. You got Vampire Weekend, Santigold, MGMT, Silversun Pickups, and IMO the greatest band still at it, Animal Collective (tho AC is much more left-field and avant). And yeah innumerable more

I went to college when that stuff was big, there’s so much great stuff that you might faintly even recognize but not know how to place it, assuming you’re the younger age bracket. I’ll post a playlist I made a while back of that era/set of sounds if you’re interested in something like this with a lil more wild at heart

Like most songs, it has the same chord progression, which is a really satisfying vibe of an earworm.  Great job on this track and bringing this tune back around.

> Incredible voice, but let's be honest, the "American Idoling" of pop music has turned voices so generic.   Once upon a time, under the wide. umbrella of pop, you had voices as diverse as Price, Cyndi Lauper, Elton John, George Michael, Sting, Billy Idol, Janet Jackson, Madonna, Boy George, The Cure, the list goes on.  Raspy voices, gruff voices, singsongy voices, melancholy voices, exuberant voices...voices with imperfections and idiosyncrasies that  made them instantly recognizable and unique.  Nowadays, it feels as thought everyone goes to the same voice coach, unique voices are buried in anonymity...

> Genuinely curious - what part of the lyrics of THIS song do you find to be standout in some way? Don't get me wrong, I found it to be an enjoyable pop song, but it didn't strike me as special or groundbreaking in any way; particularly lyrically. Half of the lyrics are tropes from pop songs of the last 40 years that have been previously written in some form or another and used countless times in other songs already. It's just a very generic "I love you so much that here's a list of things that could happen and I'd want to be with you" love song. shrug

This song will be forgotten in a year given how none of the melody or production stands out. Many disney classic remains iconic to this day so I don't see how any of the tracks fare better than disney's best. Plus it sounds super generic, fake and so not kpop.

When a real effort is made to share a cultural experience, and express that in one's art, it truly connects!
thats where Disney has been failing recently, imo. it fails to connect because its all so generic and... rinsed (eg. Snow White, Little Mermaid, Lion King and Lilo & Stitch live actions, Wish, etc) with the exception of Encanto, in their recent list. they're more afraid of hurting sentiments than concerned about telling an actual STORY

Modern day artists who know deep down inside they don’t have the talent to be remembered and valued to disappear for longer than a year, push out album after album every few months to a year and a half, hoping they can manage to push out some vocally sub-par hit with a catchy beat because now music is a highly-competitive and global market compared to how it was before the 2000s. 

Bruno’s talented enough to stay old school. It’s the way it should be. The standard for quality music production never should have changed but here we are.

### 4. @DreamMiley (confidence 0.80)

🎵 **Song:** I Wanna Be Yours — Arctic Monkeys

> This video makes me think. He is in love. I mean the title itself says it: He wants to be her's! He starts off weak, tired, and consumed with darkness. How long does he take to get up? He can hardly do it. Then, when she meets her, he's obsessed. He follows her every move and is always looking at her; where is she? How can he get to her? 

What makes my point so beautiful and impactful is that at 1:47, he is back on the floor again. This time, there is a difference. How long is he laying on the floor this time around? It is transitory; it is minuscule in comparison to when we first meet him. Does he struggle as much? No. His movements and actions are no longer dolorous. She was able to heal and take away his sorrows. 

But, as she does, she is no longer light. She is more defined with dark lines and she is no longer floating; she is weighed down my burden. As the story progresses, she loses her innocence. In the beginning she was like wind: light and free! At the end, she is more human like and is always on the ground. The only thing she has hope for or can look up to is him. He is all that matters now. She wants to be his so desperately. That is what he wanted right?

No. He wanted the version of her he created. The character he lusted after. Not the true, raw, and complex angel that she was.

The ending makes me sad and unsure about humanity. All he wanted was to be her's, yet as soon as he got her and was able to touch and connect with her, she no longer had value. She is now something he has and he is no longer fighting for her. 

How does he view himself?  If he does not love or value himself, he cannot love nor value anything he has or owns. She was not worth as much anymore because she was now his.

The woman on the other hand who starts off light, free, and energetic, calms down. She feels safe with him; she finally trusts him. 

And, as soon as she does, he loses interests. 

This is great depiction of love vs. lust! 

"I wanna be yours"

In what ways does he want to be her's? 

It is as if he is manipulating her. He is playing with her, using her, spinning her, and mending her when he was in a state of sorrow. Now he is out of his misery he has no need for her. But, she now wants to be his. 

He paid attention to her. For God's sake, he chased after her...HE WANTED TO BE HER'S!! And now nothing? What happened? Why would he do that? As soon as she felt comfortable and safe with him, he left. 

But, what if they both know that the relationship is not stable? What if they know that the only way to preserve their beings is by letting each other go?

Notice in the final scenes how she guides his hand up and slowly pushes it away. She is setting a boundary: "I cannot be yours in that manner." 

With this action, she is asking: "Are you willing to meet me where I am?"  "Do you truly want to be mine?" 

She even extends her arm out, making the path to her longer but in the end, he was not willing to compromise. He leaves.

He did not love her for the complex human being that she was. If he truly loved her, would he have not exhibited the deep passion and devotion he initially gave her?

As he leaves, she is not chasing as she usually does. She hesitates a little, but she knows that in order for both of them to thrive and be happy, they have to let each other go.

ly💞

> I can attest to trauma like that causing brain changes and health issues. I grew up with various forms of abuse and manipulation with a bpd mom. It’s a long story, but I think I have C-PTSD from my childhood, especially when my actual life was being threatened on and off where I thought I was gonna be killed. Then another day it would be happy and normal. No wonder I picked psycho guys 🤣🤣 I had no identity and was a love addict who chased guys nonstop for 10-11 years, 9 relationships. I couldn’t even stop talking to guys cuz I was addicted. Haven’t been in a relationship or hooked up with anyone in 2 years, healed a lot, learned boundaries, started understanding myself and forming my own identity. When you have a bpd parent, you are an extension of them and don’t really get the chance to have a sense of self, so it takes a lot of work to heal those things. However, I have permanent mental illness that will never go away cuz of having trauma during brain development as a child. And also, I dated narcissists, cheaters, liars, and so many horrible men. Guess what eventually happened? I went through all of that my entire life and other things that made the past few years harder. I get back on meds, I gain like 100 lbs, my already existing health issues get really bad, etc. I kept telling everyone that I think after 26-27 years of trauma, my body just shut down. For a whole year I struggled with having even enough energy to shower or microwave a meal. I was mostly in bed dealing with fatigue and multiple health issues. 
So I think you’re right, it messes up your brain and body.

I plan to lose weight for health purposes cuz I can’t do as much shit with this extra weight, and I don’t wanna be doing no fun stuff by the time I’m 30 cuz of having a hard time getting around. I know I can improve stuff in my mental and physical health, but I also accept the permanent damage and changes that cannot be changed or reversed. There has to be some form of acceptance to make peace with stuff.

Anyway, didn’t mean to write this much, but I related so much and wanted to validate what you were saying.

I hope you’re doing better! Fuck that guy and the psycho dudes out there. We deserve better! We got this! 💕💕

Very good, what if the person not getting the love is the one that she is musing about in this song. Meaning that she took love from someone I could never give it back because of the lack of the ability to grieve internally.  Like in a way that would stop you from being able to work. Billies still working she still producing stuff so whoever she was with is the person who is producing less and less powerful and she's singing a song about how they were better than her. 
But always know that that's a big manipulative maneuver because it's never good to be a hero every time you turn into a hero you turn 10 other people into victims. No Kings

In my case, that's from someone who has struggled with depression but luckily hasn't been genuinely suicidal and somehow got myself out of it for the most part (professional help does help & actually trying your best to listen to how your loved ones do care for you with the  things they do try to do, that's the only way I can explain how because otherwise I'm just as perplexed how I no longer feel that way as much---so for those suffering, know that it IS possible even when it doesn't seem like it is; I remember thinking that too and now there's times when I can't remember how it feels to be completely depressed and that's a glorious place to keep living for because it WILL happen if you keep working towards it). I highly recommend anyone struggling with depression and anxiety to get your health checked because I turned out to have an autoimmune disease that had those as symptoms and tending to my disease probably was a huge part in healing and getting to a more peaceful point too. PLEASE just keep going and fighting!!

Also: Crocodile Tears, really?! Why joke on a comment that is obviously referring to such a tough subject for others? Please learn the place and time. And why even bring a political slur into it at all?

> if you look into alot of YGs musical history as a company this is very on brand for their sound. same kinda vibe as Sentimental - Winner,  Crooked- G-Dragon. 

YG seem to be going back to their roots and realise music is meant to be experimental and interesting not the same regenerative music

You know what's an example of a real true artist?
- David Fonseca! Why?

He plays a buttload of musical instruments, he composes, he writes songs and lyrics, he sings, and everytime he launches a new album there's a few hit songs in it - ever since he started singing in a band (Silence 4) in the 90's. 

He's «A true artist! ❤» indeed! 😉
